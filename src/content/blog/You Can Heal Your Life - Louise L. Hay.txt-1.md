 Here is a summary of the key points from You Can Heal Your Life by Louise Hay:

- The book aims to take readers through a healing session, addressing problems, their origins, validity of beliefs, solutions and changing thoughts and behaviors. 

- Louise believes we create our own reality through our thoughts and are responsible for all experiences, both positive and negative. 

- core beliefs like "I'm not good enough" contribute to problems. But beliefs can be changed.

- Illnesses are created by our own thoughts, with resentment, criticism and guilt being particularly damaging. Releasing these allows healing. 

- We must forgive others and ourselves, and learn to love ourselves. Self-approval and acceptance are keys to positive change. 

- Daily affirmations, changing thoughts and behaviors can heal relationships, career, finances and physical health issues. 

- Louise shares her own story of transformation to inspire readers they can also completely change their lives for the better.

- Readers are encouraged to work through the book slowly, doing exercises to apply the lessons and change their thinking. The goal is for readers to begin healing and improving their lives.

 

- Our thoughts and beliefs create our reality. What we believe about ourselves and life becomes true for us.

- We are not limited by external forces, only by our own thinking. When we create peace in our minds, we will find it in our lives. 

- Many of us hold limiting beliefs about ourselves from a young age based on our upbringings and early environments. But we have the power to change our beliefs now.

- The past does not determine our future - our present thoughts do. We can choose new, empowering thoughts that will reshape our experiences going forward. 

- Common limiting beliefs like "I'm not good enough" undermine our ability to create joyful, prosperous lives. We can replace these with affirming self-beliefs.

- Resentment, criticism, guilt and fear cause health and relationship problems by blaming others rather than taking responsibility. Forgiveness and releasing the past can improve our lives.

- We have the power to change our attitudes about the past so it no longer limits us. Our point of power is in the present moment.

Based on this summary, the statement that sounds most consistent is "What we believe about ourselves and about life becomes true for us." The passage is encouraging taking responsibility for one's thoughts and beliefs rather than blaming external factors.

 

The passage discusses releasing resentment and forgiveness as keys to healing. It notes that it's easier to dissolve resentment when relatively minor, rather than when facing a health crisis. When panicking, it's hard to focus on healing work, so fears must be dissolved first. 

It says we must choose to believe we have power, not that we are helpless victims. We should release negative, outdated beliefs that don't support us. Even our God concept should support us. 

To release the past, we must be willing to forgive - even if we don't know how or want to. Simply being willing starts the healing. We must forgive everyone, including ourselves. Illness often stems from unforgiveness, so when sick we must see who needs forgiveness. 

The hardest person to forgive is often the one who needs it most. Forgiveness means letting go, not condoning behavior. Releasing the past and forgiving sets us free. 

Loving ourselves is the key to positive changes. Criticizing ourselves locks us in old patterns - approval and understanding help change. Even when criticizing seems to have worked before, trying approval now can lead to healing.

 Here is a summary of the key points from the passage:

- The author's philosophy is that life is simple - we get back what we give out, and our thoughts and beliefs shape our experiences. Changes can start in the present moment. 

- The main thing the author works on with clients is loving themselves. Love and self-appreciation can overcome any problem. 

- Many ways people fail to love themselves are through self-criticism, poor self-care, believing they are unlovable, undercharging for their work, and having low self-worth. 

- Babies model perfect self-love until adults teach them to deny their worth. 

- An exercise of saying positive affirmations to oneself in the mirror reveals deep-seated issues with self-acceptance. 

- Outward "problems" are rarely the real issue - those stem from inner beliefs like low self-worth, insecurity, fear, etc. Working only on superficial fixes is ineffective long-term.  

- Examples are provided of clients who manifested inner unhappiness through physical ailments, appearance issues, career struggles, etc. until addressing core self-love issues.

The key theme is that all problems originate from and are sustained by a lack of love and acceptance of oneself. The path to true change is internal through embracing self-worth.

 

- The real problem people often face is believing they are "not good enough." This stems from a lack of self-love.

- Negative self-criticism prevents self-love from developing. The counselor advises stopping all self-criticism. 

- Limiting beliefs like "I'm not good enough" come from negative messages received as a child, usually from parents.

- An exercise is done to write down all the negative messages heard from parents, relatives, teachers, etc. as a child. These formed the basis of self-limiting beliefs.

- We must see ourselves with compassion, as a small child who just wanted love and approval. Our inner child still carries those painful early messages if not addressed.

- Blaming parents is not constructive. They did the best they could but passed on their own limitations. Understanding this allows us to stop repeating the past and take control of our future thinking.

The overall message is that negative self-beliefs originate from childhood but can be overcome by identifying their source, stopping self-criticism, and learning to love and accept oneself unconditionally in the present.

 

- The passage discusses how our beliefs shape our reality and experiences. Many of our core beliefs come from messages we internalized as children from parents, teachers, peers, etc. 

- It's suggested that we unconsciously choose our parents and childhood experiences based on the lessons we came to learn. Understanding our parents' childhoods can help us have compassion for them.

- Negative beliefs we learned as children, like "I'm unworthy" or "Nobody loves me", continue to influence our lives if left unexamined. Problems are often outer manifestations of underlying inner belief patterns.

- It's important to question where our beliefs came from and whether they still serve us as adults. Many beliefs that were useful as children no longer apply but still shape our experiences. 

- By identifying the beliefs underlying our problems, we can work to change limiting beliefs and create a reality more in line with positive beliefs like "I am worthy" or "Love is everywhere." Our thoughts shape our reality and life experiences.

 

The passage discusses how our beliefs are often just opinions we have incorporated from others and now believe as our own. It notes that if we believe rainy days are inherently "lousy," we will greet rain with a negative attitude rather than embracing the present moment. 

It encourages focusing on thinking positive thoughts to create a joyful, prosperous, and loving life. Each moment is a new beginning, and we have the power to shift our patterns and problems through changing our thoughts in the present. 

Our thoughts shape our lives, so we must examine our thoughts and release any that create problems. While change can be difficult, it is important to be willing to change and examine where old beliefs need replacing. Good teachers often come from suffering and working through their own layers of limitations.

The key is to clean our mental house, examine beliefs, let go of outdated ones, and shine what we keep. We do not need to be angry with ourselves during this process of continual inner work and growth. Overall the passage promotes taking responsibility for our thoughts and embracing the power of each moment to change patterns through a shift in perspective.

 

- The passage discusses resistance to change and how awareness is the first step in healing or changing. It acknowledges that when we become aware of something we want to change within ourselves, we often feel resistance. 

- Resistance comes up strongly in the initial stages as we don't want to change or think the proposed approach is silly. This reaction actually indicates we are already in the process of healing. 

- Impatience is another form of resistance, wanting instant change rather than taking small steps over time. We must acknowledge our role in creating the situation to be able to consciously transform it. 

- When suggested solutions involve forgiving others or new approaches, we may physically show resistance through clenched jaws, crossed arms, or fists. This indicates we have identified what needs to change. 

- The hardest things for us to do represent our greatest lessons. We can both observe our resistance and still make mental changes by not letting resistance stop the process. Nonverbal clues like changing subjects or leaving a room may indicate resistance.

 Here is a summary of the different ways people procrastinate or resist change according to the passage:

- Going to the bathroom, being late, getting sick
- Doing something else to avoid the task 
- Doing busy work to avoid the task
- Wasting time to avoid the task
- Looking away or out the window to avoid paying attention
- Flipping through a magazine to avoid paying attention  
- Refusing to pay attention
- Eating, drinking or smoking to avoid the task
- Creating or ending a relationship to avoid the task
- Creating breakdowns like with cars, appliances or plumbing to avoid the task

The passage also lists common assumptions, beliefs, excuses people use to resist change like:

- It wouldn't do any good 
- Others won't understand
- I would have to change too much
- Only crazy people seek help
- Help wouldn't work for my problem
- Therapists can't handle my issues
- My case is different
- I don't want to bother anyone
- It will work itself out

And it discusses fears, delay tactics, denial, relying on others as reasons for resisting change. Overall, the passage analyzes the many subtle and not so subtle ways people avoid or delay making positive changes in their lives.

 Here are the key points made in the passage:

- Thinking "I am unworthy" can lead to procrastination as a way to avoid getting to where we want to go. Self-criticism makes procrastination and negative patterns worse by intensifying them. 

- Resenting others' good fortune or success can be a barrier to one's own growth. It stems from feeling like one never gets good things.

- Having self-worth opens many doors and opportunities. A 79-year-old client was able to get commercial work by pursuing opportunities confidently and for enjoyment rather than out of fear. 

- Self-criticism is totally missing the mark and unhelpful. It is better to release the old negative thought patterns and consciously create new, positive ones focused on self-worth.

- When trying to change a negative condition or pattern, saying affirmations to release the inner belief that is creating it can help the situation move in a positive direction, even if problems initially seem worse. This suggests the pattern is being addressed. 

- It is important to be willing to release needs for things like relationships, cigarettes, criticism etc. that may be masking deeper issues. With reflection, the underlying causes and necessary further changes may become apparent. 

- Exercises like affirming the willingness to release problem-causing patterns while making eye contact in the mirror can help strengthen commitment, even if the exact "how" is not yet clear. The subconscious mind will provide solutions if one remains willing.

So in summary, the passage argues that self-criticism intensifies problems while self-worth opens opportunities, and changing inner beliefs through willingness and affirmation can help address issues, even if outwardly problems seem worse initially, as old patterns are disrupted.

 

- Your mind is a tool that you have control over and can choose to use in any way you wish. Thoughts create experiences, so choosing empowering thoughts will empower you. 

- Habits, including thought patterns, can be changed with conscious effort and repetition of new thinking. You are in control of your mind, not the other way around. 

- The present moment is the only time you have control over. Release attachment to the past by allowing past memories to simply be memories without emotional charge. 

- Forgiveness of yourself and others is key to releasing the past. Practices like envisioning forgiveness can help dissolve resentment holding you back. 

- Physical release of pent up emotions through actions like screaming, crying, exercise can help release emotions stuck in the body from past experiences. 

- Refusing to let go of the past, whether through rumination, blame, guilt or resentment, is only hurting you now. Make peace with the past to be fully present and empowered.

The overall message is that your thoughts and state of mind are within your control to empower yourself and live fully in the present moment unrestrained by the past. Forgiveness, releasing emotions, and consciously choosing new thinking patterns can help achieve this.

 

- The passage discusses the importance of forgiveness and letting go of revenge before truly forgiving others. It provides exercises to first imagine getting revenge, then to forgive specific people by saying "I forgive you for [action]."

- It emphasizes the importance of also forgiving yourself by saying "I forgive myself for [action]." Regularly clearing resentment through forgiveness exercises can help felt lighter and freer. 

- Another visualization exercise guides imagining loving your parents, yourself, and others as small children in need of comfort. This aims to cultivate compassion and heal childhood wounds. 

- The passage encourages focusing on positive affirmations about what you want rather than negatives about what you don't want, as the latter grows what you don't want. It provides examples of turning "I don't want" statements into "I am/I have" affirmative statements. 

- Loving yourself unconditionally through self-approval and acceptance is emphasized as key to feeling good and solving problems. Regular self-affirmation exercises like saying "I love and approve of myself exactly as I am" can help develop this self-love.

 

- The passage encourages saying positive affirmations like "I approve of myself" hundreds of times per day as a way to overcome negative self-talk and build self-esteem. 

- It addresses common resistance thoughts that may come up and says to let them go and continue with the positive affirmations. 

- It frames affirmations as a way to bring buried negative thoughts to the surface in order to release them. 

- The holistic philosophy part advocates a whole-person approach of nurturing the body, mind and spirit through various healthy lifestyle practices like exercise, nutrition, meditation, self-work techniques and spiritual practices. 

- It provides examples of different modalities and practices one could explore in each area - body, mind and spirit - but emphasizes finding what works best individually through experimentation.

So in summary, it promotes positive self-affirmation as a tool for self-acceptance and talks about taking a holistic approach overall through different wellness practices for body, mind and spirit.

 

The passage discusses daily work and practicing positive thinking techniques. It emphasizes that learning new skills like positive affirmations takes regular practice over time, just as learning any new skill does. At first it may feel awkward but it gets easier with repetition. 

It's important to support and encourage oneself during the learning process rather than being critical. Practicing various reinforcement techniques can help, like gratitude, affirmations, meditation, exercise, nutrition, visualization and study. 

The author then outlines their daily routine which incorporates many of these practices, like morning affirmations, meditation, exercise, nutrition and evening reflection. 

Starting each day positively is important. Meditation is recommended as a way to calm the mind. Doing daily affirmations by writing or speaking them repeatedly helps beliefs to form over time. Keeping an attitude of openness and allowing techniques to work naturally without forcing is key. Practicing daily makes positive thinking a sustainable part of life.

 

- The book discusses how all relationships are reflections of oneself and one's beliefs and patterns. The relationships we have as children with our parents influence the relationships we form as adults. 

- An exercise is presented where the reader looks at someone in their life who bothers them, lists things they don't like about that person, and then examines where they themselves exhibit the same behaviors or beliefs. 

- The key message is that in order to change relationship dynamics, one must be willing to change oneself - to remove patterns, habits and beliefs from within. If the reader exhibits the same behaviors they dislike in others, changing themselves can lead to the other person changing or leaving their life.

- Various types of challenging relationships are discussed - with bosses, employees, co-workers, friends, lovers, spouses, children. In each case, the reader is encouraged to look within at where their own behaviors or childhood beliefs may be contributing to the friction in the relationship.

- Clearing patterns from within oneself, rather than just blaming the other person, is posited as the solution to transforming relationships into more harmonious ones.

 

- The passage discusses reframing the concept of "failure" - experiences are always perfect lessons that provide opportunity for growth if we learn from them. Failure shows an area we need to improve, not a reflection of our worth. 

- It's not productive to be hard on ourselves for mistakes or situations that didn't turn out as hoped. Instead we should acknowledge what we can learn and try another approach. 

- Success comes from continual growth, not beating ourselves up over so-called failures. Standards should match our current level to promote growth, not discouragement. 

- We should encourage ourselves like a parent does a learning child - with praise for effort and progress, not criticism. Rehearsing negative self-talk promotes discouraged learning. 

- Overall the passage promotes a growth mindset that sees all experiences, even those not meeting hopes or expectations, as opportunities to learn and improve. Reframing failure positively empowers continual success through learning.

 

- Rehearsal is an important period of time to learn, make mistakes, try new things, and learn. Learning requires practicing over and over. Professionals have put in countless hours of practice. 

- Don't refuse to try new things out of fear of looking foolish. Learning involves making mistakes until the subconscious can do it right. 

- No matter how long you've thought of yourself as a failure, you can start creating a success pattern now using affirmations. Affirmations like "I am successful" and "I attract opportunities" can be repeated daily. 

- Get rid of clutter and limiting beliefs to make room for new abundance. Clean out closets physically and mentally. Stop believing things that limit prosperity like "money doesn't grow on trees." 

- Treat bills and money with love rather than resentment. See bills as trust from creditors. Pay with joy to keep the flow of money coming in. 

- True security comes from connecting to the cosmic power that provides everything needed, not from jobs, money or people. The universe is abundant and meant to supply all needs. 

- Bless things like the phone, mail, front door to attract only good things. Expect life to be good and joyful. Don't resent or envy others' prosperity. Focus on your own thoughts.

 

- The passage discusses how mental patterns and beliefs can manifest physically in the body and lead to illnesses and diseases. 

- It presents a list of probable mental/emotional causes of illnesses and recommends corresponding new thought patterns/affirmations to address each condition. 

- Specific body parts are mentioned - the head represents the self and how we present to the world. Hair loss can be caused by tension in the scalp muscles squeezing hair follicles. 

- Baldness in women has increased as more enter high-tension careers. Tension indicates weakness while relaxation reflects true strength and security. 

- The body is a mirror of our inner thoughts. Continuous thinking patterns are reflected physically over time. We must listen to the body's messages about our mental states. 

- Affirming new, healthier thought patterns can help address illnesses and bring the mind and body into alignment for well-being. Tension in the scalp should be relaxed to support hair growth.

 

- Various body parts represent different capacities, like the ears represent hearing, eyes represent seeing, etc. Issues with those body parts often indicate an unwillingness to acknowledge something. 

- Headaches come from invalidating oneself. Migraines represent suppressed anger and pressure to be perfect.

- Sinus problems represent being irritated by someone close. Neck issues mean being stubborn in perspective. 

- The throat represents expressing oneself and creativity. Issues there indicate an inability to speak up or fully express.

- Arms represent embracing life experiences. The elbows indicate flexibility to change direction. 

- Hands grasp and hold onto things, both literally and figuratively. Tight grasping comes from fear of loss. 

- Fingers each have symbolic meanings related to ego, anger, relationships, etc. Problems indicate needing to relax and let go.

- The back represents one's support system. Upper back is emotional support, middle back is guilt, lower back is finances/worry. 

- Lungs represent ability to take in life. Issues indicate fear of fully living. 

- Breasts represent mothering. Issues mean "over-mothering" someone or something.

Overall it's suggesting that physical issues often correlate to psychological or emotional tensions, and exploring those underlying meanings can provide insight.

 This passage discusses the relationship between physical and emotional health, focusing on different parts of the body and common ailments that correspond to underlying beliefs and feelings. Some key points:

- The heart represents love and joy. Heart issues like attacks stem from denying ourselves love and joy over long periods of time. 

- The stomach digests new experiences. Stomach problems mean we have trouble assimilating new things and are afraid. Ulcers come from low self-esteem and fear of not being good enough.

- Genitals represent masculinity/femininity. Problems in this area stem from feeling ashamed of our bodies or sexuality due to messages received as children. Sex is a natural, pleasurable part of life. 

- Bladder/anal/genital problems relate to distorted beliefs about our bodies. All body parts have important functions. Sexual guilt can lead to venereal diseases seeking to "punish us."

- PMS may be linked to advertising messages making women feel their bodies are unacceptable. Feminine processes are normal and natural. 

Overall, the passage connects physical ailments to emotional stresses, fears, and negative beliefs about ourselves that can be addressed and released.

 

- There is too much emphasis placed on youth, beauty, and physical appearance in gay culture. Those who are not young and beautiful feel worthless and unwanted. 

- As gay men age, they dread getting old knowing they will be seen as useless and unwanted. Some create destructive lifestyles or feel it's better to die from AIDS than face getting old alone. 

- Attitudes like only valuing short-term sexual encounters, constant judging of physical appearances, and avoiding intimacy can create deep guilt but are rationalized through "camping."

- While pockets of acceptance have emerged, much of what gay culture has created causes pain to other gay men. The ways many gays treat each other can be as deplorable as how straights have historically treated gays. 

- Physical and mental health issues in the gay community stem from feelings of not being good enough, needing to prove self-worth through sex and partners, avoidance of intimacy, and unwillingness to change destructive behaviors and mindsets. 

- Healing involves rising above limitations of the past, accepting oneself and others unconditionally, and claiming one's inherent worth beyond physical appearance or number of partners.

 

- The passage discusses various physical ailments and their corresponding mental/emotional causes based on the author's beliefs. 

- Cancer is caused by deep resentment and sense of self-pity from childhood trauma that destroys trust in relationships. 

- Being overweight represents a need for protection from past hurts and fears. Diet and fighting fat don't work long-term; it's better to work on self-love and feeling safe. 

- Pain stems from chronic guilt seeking punishment. Guilt is useless and creates more pain; it's better to forgive and let go.

- Strokes are blood clots due to negative thinking clogging joy and flow in the brain. Laughter and flexibility prevent this. 

- Stiffness represents rigidity in mind and beliefs. Surgery has its place but healing is better focused on causes rather than just symptoms. 

- After surgery, positive affirmations and relaxing environment aid rapid healing by channeling love to the body.

- Swelling indicates holding onto hurt memories rather than releasing the past. Tumors form from nursing old hurts like an "oyster with a pearl." 

- Fear and anger in various forms are the root causes that undermine health, so releasing these feelings through faith, love and acceptance of self leads to healing.

 Here is a summary of the key points from the provided text:

- Louise Hay provides a list of common health problems and their probable mental/emotional causes based on her book "Heal Your Body". 

- For each health problem, she lists the probable mental/emotional cause(s), such as fear, anger, guilt, resentment, etc. 

- She then provides an affirmation or new thought pattern to help release and heal the mental/emotional issue associated with that health problem. The affirmations focus on self-love, trust in life, forgiveness, and emotional release.

- The list covers a wide range of health issues from head to toe, organized alphabetically. It aims to show the mind-body connection and how our thoughts and feelings can manifest physically. 

- Working through the list by finding relevant issues, reviewing the mental causes, repeating the affirmations, and assuming healing is recommended as a way to address physical problems from a mind-body perspective.

- Louise Hay's book "I Can Do It" provides additional positive affirmations to help shift one's thinking in a more empowering direction.

In summary, the text presents Louise Hay's view that many health problems have underlying mental/emotional contributors that can be transformed through affirmations, new thought patterns, forgiveness and releasing the past.

 

- Physical ailments represent emotional and mental issues that are manifesting in the body. They are signs that we need to change our thoughts and beliefs.

- Common themes associated with illness include anger, fear, resentment, guilt, stress, rigidity in thinking, lack of self-love, holding on to the past. 

- Releasing negative emotions, forgiving ourselves and others, letting go of the past, choosing positive thoughts, and appreciating life are seen as ways to remedy physical problems and bring health and well-being. 

- The body and our health reflect our inner mental and emotional state. By changing our thinking, we can effect positive change in our physical condition. Overall wellness depends on cultivating love, joy, peace and acceptance within ourselves.

So in summary, the passage sees illness as arising from emotional/mental issues, and health as regained by releasing negative thoughts and embracing love, joy and flexibility in one's mindset. Physical and spiritual well-being are viewed as interconnected.

 Here is a summary of the main points:

- Various physical ailments and diseases are seen as representing underlying emotional issues, beliefs, attitudes, etc. 

- For each ailment, one or more emotional/mental causes are proposed such as anger, fear, bitterness, resentment, lack of self-love, etc.

- Positive affirmations are then provided to counteract the perceived negative mental/emotional causes. Examples include statements about forgiveness, peace, safety, love, approval of self, etc. 

- Body parts are similarly analyzed - what they represent psychologically and how to reframe one's thoughts about that part of the body and experience.

So in summary, it takes a mind-body approach that sees physical health issues as arising from and reflecting deeper psychological/spiritual issues, and provides affirmations aimed at resolving those underlying issues. The goal appears to be moving to a place of greater peace, forgiveness and self-love.

 Here are the key points summarized from the medical conditions listed:

- Many conditions represent emotional issues like fear, anger, resentment, guilt, depression, lack of joy, difficulty with change or loss of control. 

- Specific organs and body parts are linked to emotional correlates - for example, the liver represents anger and primitive emotions while the heart represents love and joy. 

- Conditions involve limiting beliefs about oneself like not being good enough, unworthiness, or helplessness. 

- The suggested spiritual or mindset approaches emphasize releasing fear and negatives, choosing love and approval of oneself, expressing feelings constructively, and trusting in life/the healing process. 

- Flexibility, balance, forgiveness and allowing positive emotions to flow are presented as helpful mindsets. 

- Affirmations of safety, goodness, peace, freedom of expression and believing life supports one are utilized.

So in summary, this approach views illness as stemming from suppressed negative emotions and limiting beliefs, and promotes addressing the mind and beliefs through techniques like affirmation, releasing fears, and embracing positivity as a path to spiritual or mental healing. The body and its parts are seen as representing underlying emotional patterns.

 Here are the key points summarized from the text:

- Love, joy, peace of mind, balance, safety and harmony with life are emphasized as essential aspects of well-being.  

- Specific illnesses and health issues are associated with emotional patterns like fear, anger, guilt, resentment, resistance to change, lack of self-love, giving power to others, etc.

- Affirmations are provided to shift one's mindset and thought patterns towards greater acceptance, trust, flexibility, forgiveness, love of self, and allowing life's natural flow.

- Body parts are associated with core principles - for example, heart represents love, liver represents forgiveness, kidneys represent reaction to disappointment. 

- Illnesses are seen as messages about one's mental/emotional state that can be transformed by positive reframing and affirmations reinforcing well-being, peace, joy and trusting life's process.

The essentials outlined are focusing one's mind in love, acceptance and harmony rather than fear or resistance, in order to achieve mental, emotional and physical balance/healing. Affirmations of self-worth and trusting life are emphasized.

 Here are the key points about urinary infections from the provided text:

- Urinary infections indicate anger or irritation at not being able to make one's own decisions or deal with indecisive people. 

- Conditions like cystitis (bladder infection) signify feelings of vulnerability or lack of protection. There may be a belief that others are trying to "piss all over me."

- Kidney infections represent resentment built up over time from not speaking up for oneself or expressed needs. 

- Frequent urinary tract infections could mean an underlying attitude of feeling constantly irrigated or pestered by demands from others. 

- In general, urinary issues are linked to beliefs around lack of control, vulnerability, resentment of demands on one's time/energy, and an inability to make independent decisions. Letting go of these beliefs and choosing to approve of oneself is suggested to help address related physical ailments.

 I'm so sorry to hear about the immense trauma and pain you experienced as a child. No one, especially a child, deserves to go through such abuse and neglect.
