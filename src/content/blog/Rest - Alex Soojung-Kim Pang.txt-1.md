 Here is a summary of the advance praise for the book Rest:

- Wendy Suzuki, professor of neural science and psychology at NYU, praises the book for making an excellent case for the critical importance of rest in our lives. She says the book will change how readers consider rest. 

- Anthony Townsend, author of Smart Cities, says the book is a "science-packed call to arms" that will convince readers it is time to claim rest as a right and pay close attention to the needs of our overworked brains.

- Nanci Kauffman, head of Castilleja School, says the book provides "indisputable proof" that to raise healthy, happy and productive children and adults, we must teach the importance of intentional rest and balancing work with activities like play, exercise and sleep.

So in summary, the advance praise highlights that the book makes a compelling scientific case for taking rest seriously and argues it will change how readers think about the role and importance of rest in their lives and work.

 

The passage discusses how two books, Woolf's Rely Pace and Kay's Obliquity, triggered insights about Watson and Crick's discovery of DNA's structure. Specifically, Woolf argued leisure enables productivity, and Kay argued companies focusing on customer service rather than profits are more successful. 

This made the author realize Watson and Crick didn't just labor in the lab - they also had long lunches discussing ideas. Watson even found time for tennis and vacations. The author suggests maybe he was a genius because he took time for other activities, not just because of hard work. 

The author reflects on taking their own sabbatical in Cambridge, which was productive yet also relaxed. They began to question assumptions that constant connectivity and availability are necessary. Looking at past leaders' lives, they found many made time for walks, naps and vacations while still excelling. 

The passage argues overwork is actually counterproductive, as shown by past studies. It says rest must be intentionally taken, not something left over after completing other tasks. Overall, the passage discusses how history shows ambitious people can succeed while prioritizing balance and rest, counter to modern assumptions.

 

The passage discusses four key insights about rest and creativity. First, work and rest are partners - creative people alternate periods of intense work with long breaks. Second, rest is active - physical activity and even passive rest like sleep involves active brain processes. Third, rest is a skill that can be improved through deliberate practice, like other skills. Finally, deliberate rest stimulates and sustains creativity. Creative people structure their days and lives to incorporate both focused work time and downtime, which allows their subconscious minds to explore ideas. Regular rest through exercise, hobbies, and vacations renews their creative energy for long-term productivity. In contrast, always prioritizing long hours may burn people out without true benefits to productivity or longevity in creative careers. In summary, the passage examines how rest, when incorporated deliberately, actively supports and sustains creativity over the long term.

 

- The passage discusses the problem of overwork and lack of rest in modern life, contrasting it with more flexible work schedules in preindustrial times. 

- It argues that the industrial model of clearly delineated work/rest times does not fit well for knowledge work where productivity is harder to measure. 

- However, there is pressure to constantly appear busy and engaged at work due to open office environments and technologies that allow work to follow people everywhere. 

- This performance of constant busyness transforms work from something done in blocks to something that soaks one's whole life. 

- The problem of overwork has been noted as far back as the late 19th/early 20th century, but modern factors like 24/7 enterprises and work monitoring tools have made it more pervasive. 

- Overall, the passage examines how industrial models of work have shaped expectations of constant activity even when they don't suit knowledge work well, leading to problems of overwork and lack of rest.

 

- Working hours in the US and other countries have increased in recent decades, especially for salaried workers, as global competition, decreased job security, and stagnant wages have forced people to work harder to maintain their standard of living. 

- Corporations have cut staff through restructuring and outsourced work, increasing workloads on remaining employees. The 2008 recession solidified patterns of companies prioritizing increased demands on existing workers over hiring. 

- A few industries like tech and finance have winner-take-all aspects where a small number stand to gain immense fortunes, incentivizing an all-in work mentality. 

- Informal work like childcare and commuting also take more time. Ideas from the 19th century philosopher Josef Pieper about knowledge requiring leisure and contemplation were replaced by views of knowledge as a product of labor. 

- This intellectual shift and the rise of industry normalized overwork. Figures like Steve Jobs are held up as heroes for their workaholism. Modern workplace designs also embed assumptions that new ideas emerge primarily from collaborative labor rather than reflection.

So in summary, a combination of economic, corporate, cultural, and intellectual forces over the last century have normalized and even valorized overwork at the expense of leisure and contemplation.

 

The passage describes the scientific discovery of the default mode network (DMN) in the brain and its importance during rest and unconscious mental processing. Pioneering neuroscientists Biswal and Raichle used early brain imaging technologies and observed consistent low-frequency activity in the resting brain, contrary to expectations that it would be inactive. This indicated the brain's default mode network automatically activating during rest to support inward-focused cognition. 

Subsequent research showed the DMN remains highly energetic even at rest and can switch on/off rapidly. The DMN is proposed to perform critical unconscious work like consolidating memories, making sense of experiences, and unconsciously searching for solutions during periods of reduced external focus. Individual variations in DMN structure and connectivity correlate with traits like creativity, cognitive abilities, mental health, life outcomes, and psychological development. A well-developed DMN appears important for complex functions like self-awareness, empathy, imagination, and moral reasoning. Damage to the DMN is associated with cognitive impairments and mental illnesses. The findings suggest periods of rest allow the unconscious mind to organize information and generate ideas, revealing the scientific importance of relaxation and unconscious mental processing.

 

The brain has a default mode network (DMN) that is active when the mind is at rest or wandering, instead of focused on external tasks. Research has found the DMN plays an important role in various cognitive functions like intelligence, moral judgment, empathy, and mental health. 

Mind wandering, or task-unrelated thinking, occurs naturally when the mind is not fully occupied. It was long thought to be unproductive, but research now shows mind wandering can actually enhance creativity. Studies found periods of mind wandering or low-level background tasks and noise can improve performance on divergent thinking and creative problem-solving tests. 

The brain regions involved in mind wandering and the DMN overlap with those activated during creative thinking tasks. People with more creative minds show stronger connectivity within the DMN and between the DMN and other brain regions linked to relevant skills. This enhanced connectivity may allow their brains to keep unconsciously working on problems during periods of mind wandering or rest, boosting creativity.

 

- Studies have found some areas of the default mode network (DMN) are less active or integrated in creative people. 

- Creative thinking involves two steps - idea generation and idea evaluation. Different brain regions are involved in each step.

- In creative individuals, the idea generation region has more freedom to produce ideas, while the evaluative region is less tightly integrated into the DMN. 

- Research found higher scores on creativity tests correlated with lower activity in left temporal and frontal regions associated with idea evaluation. 

- Cases of people developing new creative abilities after brain injuries or strokes in the left temporal region, which houses the evaluative center, provide evidence for the two-step model. 

- Together, these studies suggest the DMN is a source of raw creative energy, and creative people have a differently organized DMN that allows them to better access this energy. However, neuroscience still has limitations in fully explaining creativity.

 

- Charles Darwin and John Lubbock were neighbors and friends who lived in the village of Downe, England. While they were both highly accomplished scientists, their personalities and daily routines differed. 

- Darwin was a more reserved gentleman who preferred the company of his family and books. He worked steadily each morning for around 3 hours, then took long walks and naps in the afternoon. Despite relatively modest daily "work" hours, he authored 19 books, including Origin of Species.

- Lubbock was more extroverted and social. In addition to his scientific work, he inherited a successful bank, spent decades in Parliament, and wrote 29 books on various topics. 

- Graham Wallas suggested that examining the biographies of 200 original thinkers could yield insights into how rest stimulates creativity. Rest may inspire the formulation of guidelines for cultivating creativity. 

- While Darwin and Lubbock were dedicated scientists, their great accomplishments did not result from endless hours of toil. Their success suggests creativity and productivity are not solely the product of long work hours, but also involve periods of rest and relaxation. Examining creative lives may teach us how labor and rest interact to stimulate innovative thought.

 

- John Lubbock was a highly accomplished politician, scientist, banker and businessman in late 19th century Britain. He held many roles simultaneously and was notably prolific, which surprised even Charles Darwin. 

- However, Lubbock advocated for rest and is credited with establishing Britain's first bank holidays in 1871. He championed legislation to limit working hours for those under 18. 

- Despite coming from aristocracy, he genuinely cared about workers' welfare, not just populism. He managed his own time well with routines like half-hour blocks. 

- Many other famous scientists and thinkers also combined great accomplishments with apparently short working days of 4-6 hours, through routines that blended focused work periods with rest, exercise and recreation. Examples given include Darwin, Poincare, Hardy, Littlewood and Mann. 

- Studies found scientists were most productive working 10-20 hours per week, not more, and many did creative work at home as well as in the office or lab. Overall, the evidence suggests blending focused work with rest led to high achievement, creativity and happiness for scholars even in Lubbock's era.

 

Trollope and other prolific authors like Dickens maintained a strict daily writing schedule, commonly working for four hours in the morning. This allowed them to be highly productive while still holding down full-time jobs. Trollope wrote 1,000 words per hour, averaging 40 pages per week. Dickens worked from 9am to 2pm daily while also meeting publishing deadlines. Many modern writers also stuck to similar routines, limiting their writing time to a few focused hours each morning or afternoon. This discipline allowed them to be creative while also balancing other responsibilities in their lives.

 

- The study by Anders Ericsson on violin students at the Berlin Conservatory found that the top performers engaged in "deliberate practice" of around 4 hours per day, with frequent shorter sessions of around 80-90 minutes each separated by 30 minute breaks. 

- They were able to maximize their limited practice time in this way, as sustained intense focus could only be maintained for around 4 hours per day due to mental and physical resource limitations. 

- Interestingly, the top performers also slept around 1 hour more per day than average performers, often taking naps in the afternoon. Their practice schedule involved intensive morning practice followed by an afternoon nap and then another evening practice session.

- They also tracked their leisure time more accurately than average performers, spending fewer total hours but managing it more deliberately. This suggests they applied habits of focus and optimization from practice to their downtime as well. 

- Overall, the key to gaining 10,000 hours of practice according to Ericsson's findings is not just practicing intensely for 4 hours a day, but also deliberately resting and optimizing the use of time, including longer and more deliberate sleep. However, subsequent discussions have tended to overlook this important aspect related to deliberate rest.

 

- Scott Adams, creator of the comic strip Dilbert, follows a very strict morning routine where he wakes up early and does nothing but work on Dilbert for 2-3 hours. There is no variation in this routine. 

- He has followed this routine for nearly 20 years as it allows him to be creative without external distractions and sets the "trap" to allow ideas to emerge. It has helped him turn Dilbert into a successful global franchise.

- Many other creative people like writers, artists, and scientists also follow early morning routines where they work without interruptions right after waking up. This gives them focused creative time before daily obligations.

- Working in the mornings may boost creativity as inhibition is lower when energy levels dip during the circadian rhythm. Studies show people can be more insightful and imaginative in the late afternoon compared to optimal morning energy times.

- Having a consistent morning routine creates space for rest and makes rest more valuable for creativity. It allows creative people to be deliberate about rest and primes their subconscious to keep working on problems overnight.

 

The study found that being outside one's circadian peak can turn distractions into advantages under the right circumstances. When given an insight problem test, participants performed better when shown related "helpful" distractors during their circadian low periods, compared to misleading distractors. This suggests circadian lows impair inhibition in a way that can benefit problem solving if the environment contains relevant cues. 

Creative people sometimes take advantage of this effect by working during their circadian low periods, when their minds are more open to helpful associations and insights. Their environments are designed to surround them with relevant materials and shield them from irrelevant distractions. Having clear boundaries between work and rest also allows for greater productivity and recharging. 

Routine is also important for creative work. Many prolific creators like Stephen King work consistently for a few hours each day, following regular schedules and routines. Routine supports creativity by habituating the mind and making it consistently ready to work. It leads to greater overall production than sporadic bursts of effort. The work itself drives creativity over time, as routines provide a reliable space for ideas to form.

 

The passage discusses how routine and freedom or control over one's work can enhance creativity. It notes a study that found employees with more routine tasks exhibited more creativity if they also had autonomy in how they organized their work. This allowed them to reflect on improvements and feel empowered to make suggestions. 

It then provides other examples supporting the idea that routine can support creativity. Shared routines help groups work better. Routines conserve willpower, resilience and motivation for harder problems. They also save time by automating certain tasks. 

For creative people like writers and chefs, routines can help get in a state of flow where they work quickly and at a high level. Small daily goals from routines can stimulate without being overly demanding. 

The passage argues routines are important for rest and creativity. They protect time for rest and allow more work to get done. While inspiration cannot be commanded, routines and regular work can "nudge" inspiration by keeping the unconscious mind active. Many creative thinkers used walks as part of their routine, finding it stimulated fresh thinking. Walking meetings have also grown popular in technology companies.

 

- Some companies have designated mapped walking routes around their campuses and allow employees to schedule "walking meeting rooms" in their calendars for walking meetings. 

- Walking meetings provide physical and mental stimulation compared to sitting meetings. They can also feel more private and relaxed, making certain sensitive topics easier to discuss. 

- Executives like walking meetings because they eliminate distractions and allow continuous focus on a topic for more than a few minutes at a time. 

- An important 1938 walking meeting between Howard Florey and Ernst Chain led to their development of penicillin. 

- Many famous thinkers and creatives found walking relaxing and helpful for loosening inhibitions and generating new ideas, including scientists, economists, composers, and physicists. 

- Walking may stimulate creativity by providing enough diversion to occupy the conscious mind while leaving the subconscious free to work. This can lead to sudden insightful breakthroughs emerging from subconscious thinking during walks.

- However, these insightful walks often followed long periods of preparation and incubation working on the problem, consistent with models of the creative process, rather than walking itself stimulating the insights.

 

- Bik and McClintock had insights during walks, but that doesn't necessarily mean walking causes insights. People also report insights in the shower. 

- An experiment by Oppezzo and Schwartz found that walking improved performance on creativity tests requiring divergent thinking, but not convergent thinking which requires focus. 

- Subsequent experiments ruled out alternative explanations like practice effects or being outdoors. Walking itself seemed to boost divergent thinking creativity regardless of location.

- The mechanism is unclear but could involve mood, focus that allows new ideas, or more ideas bubbling up. 

- Many creative people carry notebooks on walks to capture ideas, suggesting walking helps spark creativity even if the link is not fully understood.

 

The passage discusses how napping can boost creativity for some people. It provides examples of famous creative individuals like Winston Churchill, Barbara McClintock, Haruki Murakami, and several authors who incorporated napping into their daily routines. 

Churchill took afternoon naps as a way to renew his energy levels during World War II. Other Allied leaders like Eisenhower and MacArthur also followed napping schedules. Studies show napping, especially lying down, can be more restorative than just sitting up. 

Research has found that even short naps of 20-30 minutes can recharge mental batteries and possibly spark new ideas. Creatives like Bradbury, Tolkien, and Franzen used strategic afternoon naps to boost their writing sessions. Murakami and Gibson also credit naps for helping their creative processes. 

While napping habits may seem counterintuitive for workaholics, even obsessive architects like Wright and Kahn incorporated naps to break up their long work days, demonstrating how napping can be a useful skill for maintaining creativity.

 

- Thomas Edison and other famous inventors and leaders like Churchill, Johnson, and Wright were known to take short naps in the afternoon to be more productive and maximize their time. Edison's secretary called his naps his "secret weapon."

- A short 20-minute nap can boost alertness and reduce fatigue. Regular naps, not just single naps, provide additional benefits like improved memory consolidation. 

- Studies show that naps containing slow-wave sleep and REM sleep significantly improve memory and learning retention compared to no nap. Even 5-minute naps provide some benefit.

- Naps can help solidify new skills and memories by "replaying" experiences during sleep, as shown in studies with rats. 

- Naps improve emotional regulation and self-control, reducing impulsivity and helping one better handle frustration, according to studies examining tasks like tolerating frustration.

- Properly timed longer naps of 60-90 minutes can provide the same cognitive benefits as a full night's sleep by allowing the full sleep cycle to occur. Regular afternoon naps can help maximize productivity and create "two-shift" days.

 

- Our circadian rhythm and sleep pressure cycles interact to determine the type and quality of sleep we get. 

- When we go to bed, sleep pressure is high so we get more deep, restorative slow-wave sleep. As the night progresses, sleep pressure decreases and we shift into more REM sleep.

- These cycles can get out of sync due to things like jet lag, night shifts, or irregular schedules.

- Nap timing can be used to tailor naps for different benefits. A 20-minute nap around 1pm provides mental recharge without grogginess. A 1 hour nap balances REM and slow-wave sleep. 

- Some highly creative people like writers and artists have used naps, especially short hypnagogic naps, to access subconscious ideas and inspiration. Salvador Dali developed a systematic "slumber with a key" method to take very short naps and harness dream imagery.

- The hypnagogic state between waking and sleep allows access to subconscious processes and ideas in a fluid, associative way to spark creativity and problem solving. Dali would nap this way to churn out dreamlike images for his art.

 

- Several famous artists and writers like Salvador Dalí, Edgar Allan Poe, and André Breton used hypnagogia, or the state between waking and sleeping, to access creative ideas and inspiration from their subconscious minds. 

- Dalí would induce hypnagogia through a methodical process of relaxation and prepare images and ideas in his mind before painting. Poe and Breton had developed their writing careers significantly before discovering hypnagogia.

- Modern psychologists recommend techniques like the "Upright Napping Procedure" to access hypnagogic states for creativity without the need for an artist's studio. It involves closing your eyes at your desk when drowsy but not fully falling asleep. 

- Many creative people like Ernest Hemingway advised stopping work for the day when still inspired, with the next steps in mind. This allows the subconscious to continue working on ideas overnight without conscious interference. It also prevents burnout and promotes a steady, long-term pace of productivity.

- Inducing hypnagogia and stopping work daily in a state of inspiration taps into natural creative processes of the subconscious mind during rest and allows ideas to incubate outside of conscious awareness.

 Here is a two-minute summary:

The researchers conducted an experiment to test how taking a break during a creative task impacts idea generation. Three groups did a divergent thinking task for two minutes. The first two groups did a similar task for five minutes, while the third group did something completely different. Then all groups did the original task for another two minutes. 

All groups generated about 14 ideas in the first two minutes. In the second two minutes, the first two groups generated around 7 ideas but the third group that switched tasks generated almost 10 ideas. This showed that taking a break on an unrelated task is more beneficial for idea generation than continuing a similar task or working continuously. 

The researchers then explored if highly creative people benefit more from breaks. Participants did the divergent thinking task, then math problems, and then the task again. For some, the second task was expected, while it was a surprise for others. Everyone's scores increased after the break as expected. But those who expected the second task saw a greater increase, showing knowing they would return to the task engaged their subconscious more. Additionally, highly creative people in the expected condition saw an even bigger boost, showing their subconscious minds worked harder during the break. This suggests creative people are better able to utilize unconscious processes.

 

Spending energy on motor activity and cognitive functions during the day exhausts our bodies. When we sleep, our bodies shift to maintenance and repair mode. Deep slow-wave sleep, indicated by low-frequency delta brain waves, stimulates the release of growth hormone which helps repair cells and supports growth in children. REM sleep, marked by rapid eye movements and higher brain activity, facilitates memory consolidation and myelination through oligodendrocytes. 

Maiken Nedergaard's research found the cerebrospinal fluid that surrounds the brain clears toxins efficiently during sleep as glial cells shrink, expanding fluid flow channels. Specifically, beta-amyloid clearance important for Alzheimer's prevention doubles during sleep. Sleep deprivation studies show impaired situational awareness, decision-making and performance in military operations due to fatigue. Pilots on extended missions also reported common incidents of unintended sleep and slowed reactions from sleep loss. Overall, sleep supports crucial brain and body maintenance functions.

 

- Fatigue was a major factor in many accidental deaths and "friendly fire" incidents early in wars like Vietnam, Korea, and WWII. Sleep deprivation impaired performance. 

- Studies show night shifts negatively impact doctors' and nurses' cognitive performance over time due to disrupted sleep and increased stress. Senior physicians cope better than interns. 

- Shift work is linked to higher risks of diseases like ulcers, cardiovascular issues, breast cancer, obesity, diabetes, and hypertension due to disrupted circadian rhythms and less total sleep. 

- Sleep deprivation may contribute to or accelerate dementia by eroding deep sleep stages and REM sleep, which are important for brain health and cognitive functioning. Improving sleep quality may help slow cognitive decline.

- Strategic napping has been shown to help mitigate effects of fatigue for shift workers and military personnel, improving alertness and performance especially during demanding tasks like approach/landing. Short naps can be surprisingly restorative.

- Sleep gives the brain time to repair itself and process/consolidate memories from the day into short and long-term storage, especially visual tasks and skills during REM sleep. Disrupting REM sleep impairs this memory consolidation.

 

The researchers conducted an experiment where they had groups of subjects learn and perform a task. On some nights after performing the task, the subjects were allowed to sleep normally. On other nights, the researchers interrupted the subjects' REM sleep by waking them up whenever REM sleep began. They found that on days after uninterrupted sleep, the groups' performance on the task improved. However, when their REM sleep was interrupted, their performance did not improve. Other studies have also found that people with insomnia have impaired memory consolidation. 

Neuroscientist Kieran Fox argues that dreaming is similar to waking mind-wandering, as the subjective experiences and brain regions involved are comparable. The fact that tasks and problems are replayed and reviewed during sleep may help explain why people can dream about work and problem-solving. However, for most creative people, sleep and dreams play a more indirect role by loosening ideas that become clearer when waking. Some notable examples where complete solutions appeared in dreams are exceptions rather than the norm. 

For innovators like Hans Bethe, Linus Pauling, and Glenn Seaborg, answers to problems did not necessarily come directly from dreams, but sleep and dreaming helped ideas become accessible when awake. Athletes have also described dreams helping with problem-solving or improving skills. Overall, insights from sleep follow a four-stage problem-solving process involving preparation, an incubation period of sleep, and then a clarifying dream or morning realization. While sleep continues mental work, most do not expect direct revelations and see waking and sleeping minds as complementary partners.

 

The passage discusses how vacations and breaks from work are important for recovery from job stress and burnout. It gives an overview of research showing the health, productivity, and career benefits of taking vacations, as well as the costs of not taking vacations. 

Specifically, it discusses how burnout can harm health, job performance, public safety occupations like policing, and lead to higher turnover. It also notes how vacations can boost creativity and the origins of ideas.

The work of German sociologist Sabine Sonnentag is highlighted, who has extensively researched what types of breaks are most effective for recovery. She found relaxation, control over one's time, engaging mastery experiences, and detachment from work are important factors. Activities high in these facilitate better well-being, focus, and productivity upon returning to work. Her research across many professions consistently supports the benefits of recovery breaks for workers and their employers.

 

The importance of psychological detachment from work as a factor in recovery was first observed in a 1998 study of Israeli military reservists. Researchers found that reservists reported lower stress and burnout after returning from short deployments, even if the deployments were physically and mentally challenging. Subsequent studies in other countries yielded similar findings. 

Factors that promote recovery from work include relaxation, pursuing mastery experiences, detachment from work, and control over one's time. Active and engaging non-work activities are more beneficial than passive leisure. Hobbies or sports that demand commitment and concentration help psychologically detach from work. Carrying work devices on non-work time or worrying about work at home prevents recovery. 

While vacations provide an initial boost to happiness and well-being, these effects fade after a few weeks as people return to normal routines. Happiness peaks around the first week of vacation and levels off or declines afterward. Shorter but more frequent breaks may promote better recovery than long annual vacations. Being able to psychologically detach from work, even on evenings and weekends, is critical for recovery.

Eisenhower's private cottage during World War 2 allowed for relaxation, games, relaxation and control over his schedule - helping him recover from stresses of his command through psychological detachment. Regular breaks from work through engaging non-work activities are important for recovery of mental resources.

 

The passage discusses research that challenges the idea that intellectual and athletic pursuits are mutually exclusive. A longitudinal study of scientists found that those who achieved the most distinguished careers were unusually likely to participate in athletic activities over their lifetime. In particular, highly successful scientists in the study reported high rates of playing sports, taking advantage of opportunities for activities like hiking, swimming, and surfing in Southern California. Their less accomplished peers tended not to maintain sports or physical activities after school. 

This finding challenges the assumption that cultivation of the mind requires denial of the body. The passage cites several examples of successful scientists who were also accomplished athletes, like Marie Curie. Conversely, it notes some highly trained athletes like Bill Bradley and Byron White who also had distinguished academic careers. Overall, the research suggests physical activity and exercise may help sustain creativity and productivity over the long term for scientists and other intellectual professionals.

 

The passage discusses how some intellectual communities in the 19th century viewed sports and academic study as mutually supportive. At Cambridge University, many top performers on the grueling Tripos exams participated in regular physical exercise like rowing. They believed exercise complemented and facilitated intense study. Charles Sherrington's laboratory at Oxford attracted accomplished scientists who were also athletes. Sherrington himself was a committed athlete. His students included prominent sports players who went on to make contributions to neuroscience. Other intellectual communities that combined academics and athletics included mountain climbers and scientists in the early-to-mid 20th century. While Sherrington's students did not study the effects of exercise on cognition, modern research shows physical fitness improves brain structure and function, and can boost intelligence and mental performance. Activities like running specifically stimulate neurogenesis and the production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor.

 Here is a summary of the key points:

- Aerobic exercise has been shown to provide a small boost to creativity for people who are physically fit, though not for non-exercisers. 

- Although exercise may not directly stimulate ideas, writers report it improves mental stamina and the ability to develop ideas over long periods of focused work.

- Regular exercise strengthens cardiovascular health and brain circulation, improving memory and executive function. It also stimulates growth of new blood vessels in the brain.

- Physical stamina aids in maintaining focus and concentration for cognitively demanding jobs and creative works over long hours. Many successful scientists, writers and chess players engage in strenuous exercise routines.

- Exercise relieves stress and increases capacity to handle pressure, which is important for high-stress careers. It can retrain the body's stress response.  

- Being an athlete earlier in life is correlated with higher incomes, career success and skill development later in life. Employers favor ex-athletes due to positive stereotypes.

- Physical activity in aging is linked to slower cognitive decline and better brain structure over time compared to inactive peers. It may help preserve mental abilities.

 Here is a summary of the key points about the cognitive health of elderly Scottish people based on the provided text:

- In 1947, scientists administered intelligence tests to nearly every 11-year-old in Scotland. About 60 years later, they tracked down 1000 members of this group to re-administer the same 1947 test as well as new cognitive and physical health tests. 

- This group, now called the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936, is providing insights into cognitive aging as current test results can be compared to their scores as 11-year-olds. 

- A study of this group found a positive correlation between physical activity levels, brain connectivity, and white matter quantity/density in older age.

- Other long-term studies have also observed a link between physical activity in midlife (40s-50s) and reduced chronic disease/dementia risk later in life. Exercise in midlife promotes cognitive health.

- The example of Olympic athlete Olga Kotelko showed that starting physical activity and training even in late life (age 77) can positively impact brain structure and cognition in older age.

So in summary, the text discusses research on the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 which demonstrates links between physical activity, brain structure/connectivity, and cognitive functioning in elderly people.

 

The passage describes how Lawlor's work building the Electric Giraffe started as a side project but took on a life of its own as he spent increasing amounts of time working on it. Over many years, Lawlor has continued improving and upgrading the giraffe, keeping it as an "endless canvas" to work on. 

The Electric Giraffe illustrates the concept of "deep play" - activities that are intrinsically rewarding, mentally absorbing, allow use of relevant skills, and provide a connection to one's past. Deep play provides important benefits like recovery from work stresses. Creative people engage in deep play activities that become absorbing projects pulling them in unexpected directions. 

The passage gives examples of how scientists and inventors like Norman Maclean, Albert Michelson and Winston Churchill engaged in deep play activities like billiards, violin playing, painting, sailing and tennis to recover from stressful work. These activities mentally absorbed them, allowed use of relevant skills, provided different rewards than work, and connected to their past, demonstrating how deep play can foster continued productivity.

 

- Churchill saw parallels between painting and military command, describing both as requiring careful planning and maintaining a strong strategic reserve. He found painting provided enjoyable physical release from his political duties. 

- Sailing also provides scientists and engineers a constructive break from work by engaging similar problem-solving and observational skills in an intense physical way. It refreshed their thinking for Britton Chance, a biophysicist who saw sailing as a family activity, competitive sport, and break from 60-hour work weeks. 

- Elite mountain climbing fully absorbs scientists' attention through difficult challenges, allowing them to discover connections to their work. It provides meditative focus unlike lighter activities. Problem-solving skills from sciences aid climbing for some.

- Scientists drew parallels between experiment design and route planning in climbing. Both require stepping strategies and judgment with unknown challenges. Success in climbing is quicker but unambiguous, unlike drawn-out experiments. Climbing also provides confidence and perspective difficult to find competitively in science.

 Here are the key points summarized:

- Wilder Penfield began a second career as a writer after retiring from neurosurgery at age 70. He had been writing faithfully to his mother for decades, developing the habits of a regular writer. His correspondence helped sharpen his writing skills. 

- James Herriot, known for his veterinarian stories, began writing fiction in his late 40s after years of writing diligently to his parents. He gradually focused his stories on animals, Yorkshire, and country vet life. 

- Bram Stoker wrote Dracula while managing the Lyceum Theatre, working on the novel during summers away. He drew details from London's theatrical world and the people in actor Henry Irving's social circle. 

- J.R.R. Tolkien privately invented languages and mythology for decades before writing The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings. He was fascinated by languages from a young age and used inventing stories as a way to remember his mother after her death. 

- Deep play and hobbies pursued over many years can incubate unexpected creative works or second careers later in life through the skills and perspectives developed. Regular writing habits like letters were important incubators.

 

The passage discusses the concept of deep play and how it provides important benefits to creative people. It uses the example of physicist Albert Michelson, who found activities like billiards, painting, music, and mountain climbing to be personally rewarding ways to rest and restore his mental energy away from his lab work. While not as good of a "game" as physics, these pursuits allowed him to develop new skills, connect to his family and childhood, and see nature from different perspectives. 

The passage argues that creative people are able to see their deep play activities as extensions of their professional interests in fields like problem-solving and nature appreciation. This helps bridge the divide between work and leisure and justifies spending serious time on hobbies. Deep play also demands exclusive focus, creating clear boundaries between work and rest. Studies have shown top scientists who engaged in deep play through hobbies were more productive than those who did not. Their diverse activities were unified by common themes.

Taking inspiration from figures like designer Stefan Sagmeister and chef Ferran Adrià, the passage endorses the benefits of sabbaticals for creative renewal and experimentation beyond normal constraints. This allows people to significantly impact their fields upon returning, remaining at the cutting edge of invention and success. Deep play and sabbaticals are presented as essential for the productivity and longevity of creative careers.

 

The passage discusses how sabbaticals can benefit creativity and innovation, even for short periods of time. It provides examples of influential figures like Bill Gates, Greg Koch, and Johann Rupert who have taken sabbaticals and found them immensely helpful. Gates instituted an annual think week where he would immerse himself in technical literature to gain broader perspective. Samsung implemented a successful sabbatical program that helped develop future executives. The passage also notes how top American generals in WWII, like George Marshall and Dwight Eisenhower, used slower periods between wars to study modern strategy and foreign cultures, better preparing them to lead. Even short breaks like what Douglas Engelbart experienced being stranded in the Philippines can spark new ideas, like his realization of how computers could augment human intelligence. In summary, the passage advocates that sabbaticals and periods of focused thinking away from day-to-day pressures can drive major creative and intellectual breakthroughs.

 

Travel and time spent abroad can positively shape creativity in several ways. Studies show that being exposed to different cultures, through things like living abroad, can enhance performance on creative thinking tests. Researchers have also found that people who identify with multiple cultures, known as biculturals, tend to be more innovative and get promoted faster in creative industries. 

A study of fashion designers found that those with more international experience tended to be rated as more creative by industry experts. Having experience in multiple countries, as well as experience in culturally distant places, provided an early creative boost. However, spending significant time living abroad - developing a deeper understanding of other cultures - had the strongest long-term impact and was most important for creativity over the long run. Exposure to different environments through travel and living situations abroad can stimulate creative thinking by broadening perspectives.

 

- Taking regular breaks and sabbaticals can help stimulate creativity and renewal by escaping everyday routines and constraints. Experiences abroad can foster new perspectives if done in moderation rather than excessively. 

- Examples are given of how sabbaticals benefited designers, executives, scientists, and military officers. Features of successful sabbaticals included being in a new but accessible environment, pursuing self-directed goals, and detaching from regular responsibilities. 

- Short breaks can still be restorative if done skillfully. Even a month away can be life-changing. The most fruitful breaks tend to involve active engagement through reading, travel, collaborations rather than pure idleness. 

- Deliberate rest requires recognizing its importance, planning time for it, and defending that time from unnecessary demands. This focus helps concentrate on what matters most and avoid pointless busyness. Practicing rest leads to a richer, calmer life where success comes from inner self-mastery rather than a frazzled appearance. Regular rest was seen as a sign of leadership throughout much of history.

 This passage discusses the benefits of deliberate rest and how it can help with creativity, focus, productivity and living a fulfilling life. Some key points:

- Deliberate rest helps cultivate calm and reduces anxiety, which allows one to work steadily and focus on important tasks. It also encourages setting boundaries between work and personal time.

- Deliberate rest gives more time by helping maintain boundaries and use leisure time effectively. It reduces feelings of time pressure. Highly successful people see work and rest as connected and mutually supportive. 

- Active forms of rest like hiking are more effective than passive entertainment. Deliberate rest guards against narrowness and intellectual stagnation. 

- Over the long term, deliberate rest restores energy, gives more time, helps achieve more while working less, and allows one to focus on meaningful challenges. It helps craft a rewarding life. 

- Many highly creative/productive people lived into their 80s while remaining engaged through deliberate rest and balance between work and other pursuits. Rest is not idleness when treated as work's equal partner.

So in summary, the passage argues that deliberate rest is an important part of cultivating creativity, focus, productivity and overall life satisfaction and fulfillment over the long run.

 Here is a summary of the key points about the benefits of napping from the sources provided:

- Napping can help enhance creativity and problem-solving by facilitating insight and breakthroughs. Famous scientists, writers and inventors like Hamilton, Heisenberg, Rubik and McClintock had creative ideas or solutions that came to them during naps or rest periods. 

- Carrying notebooks allowed thinkers like Selye, Hamilton, Miranda and Wilder to capture ideas that came to them. Hobbes, Hilbert and others also took notes during periods of rest.

- Leaders like Churchill, MacArthur, Kennedy and Johnson regularly took short naps to boost their performance and manage stress and fatigue. Upright napping was shown to be more beneficial than horizontal napping in some studies. 

- Napping can boost memory consolidation and learning. Studies on rats and humans found naps helped improve spatial memory and retention of new information. Brief 10-20 minute naps were sufficient for benefits.

- Naps may help reduce impulsivity and improve decision-making by counteracting effects of ego depletion and sleep deprivation on prefrontal cortex function. Lack of sleep has been linked to impaired ethical judgments.

- The hypnagogic state between waking and sleeping aided the creativity of thinkers like Dalí, Poe and Breton. Guided naps using techniques like Nielsen's can help harness productive hypnagogic imagery.

So in summary, napping provides cognitive, memory, stress-reducing and creativity benefits through various physiological and psychological mechanisms when incorporated strategically into one's daily routines.

 Here is a summary of the sources provided:

Several authors discuss stopping, incubation, and unconscious work in developing ideas. Salman Rushdie, Mario Vargas Llosa, Ian Littlewood, Neal Stephenson, and John McPhee discuss taking breaks and letting ideas incubate unconsciously. Hemingway, le Carré, and Poincaré discuss ideas emerging from the subconscious during sleep. University of Sydney research found creative advantages from non-conscious processes. Ed Smith notes some see idleness as the best investment. 

There is significant literature on the importance of sleep. Books by Arianna Huffington, Jonathan Crary, and A. Roger Ekirch explore its social and historical aspects. Research shows sleep aids memory consolidation and clearing of metabolites. Sleep deprivation hurts performance for soldiers, pilots, surgeons, and others. It increases health risks like dementia. Strategic napping can help compensate. REM sleep aids skill learning. Slow-wave sleep strengthens memories. Dreams may relate to mind wandering and problem solving. Historic figures like Bethe, Pauling, and Seaborg report insights from dreams.

 Here is a summary of the provided sources:

- Simon Jenkins describes golf and dreaming, referencing works by Richard Coop on Nicklaus and sleep/dreams in creative lives by Deirdre Barrett. 

- Joseph Jastrow is cited for a closing quotation, and David Samson and Charles Nunn's theory on sleep intensity and human cognition is referenced.

- Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's work on flow is also cited. Examples of chess players and Bletchley Park are given regarding detachment. 

- Military deployment and travel are discussed as forms of respite by Etzion, Sthultz, Johnson, and Horsman. Impact of communication technology on detachment is noted.

 Here are summaries of the key papers:

- "High Tech Tethers and Work-Family Conflict: A Conservation of Resources Approach" (2012) - Examines how constant connectivity through technology like Blackberries can increase work-family conflict and reduce well-being. Having more job control and psychological detachment from work can help mediate these negative effects. 

- "A Conservation of Resources Approach to Blackberry Use, Work-Family Conflict and Well-Being" (2014) - Builds on the previous paper, finding that job control and psychological detachment from work partially mediate the relationship between extended work availability through technology and poorer well-being and increased work-family conflict.

- "Extended Work Availability and Its Relation with Start-of-Day Mood and Cortisol" (2016) - Studies the physiological effects of being constantly available for work. Found that employees who were easily contactable outside of work hours had higher cortisol levels in the morning, indicating more stress, than those who could better detach from work. 

The other papers examine the benefits of vacations and time off from work. They generally find that vacations provide relief from job stress and burnout, but that these benefits fade within a few weeks of returning to work without adequate respite periods. Regular time off is needed to continue seeing reductions in stress, burnout, and absenteeism.

 Here is a summary of the key points from the provided sources:

- Several studies found benefits of aerobic exercise for cognitive function, including improved performance on creativity tasks. Running can provide a mental break from other tasks. 

- Top athletes and scientists frequently engaged in other intensive hobbies in addition to their primary pursuits. This included painting for Churchill, sailing for Britton Chance, and billiards for Albert Michelson. 

- Deep engagement in mentally or physically demanding activities beyond one's main occupation may provide benefits like stress relief, resilience against burnout, and cross-training effects that enhance performance. 

- Longitudinal studies show strong links between physical activity levels and cognitive performance in aging. Staying active in later life is associated with successful aging. 

-Many historically significant figures like Darwin, Turing, and Mandela were physically very active and engaged in sports throughout their lives. This energetic lifestyle may have supported their intellectual and professional achievements.

- Activities like chess, surgery, and business leadership also benefit from underlying physical fitness. Staying active can complement and enhance cognitive skills in diverse domains.

 Here is a summary of key points about scientists taking sabbaticals from the passage:

- Many scientists have taken extended breaks from their normal work to gain new perspectives or insights. Examples mentioned include Douglas Engelbart spending time on Leyte Island during World War 2 and coming up with early concepts of personal computing, and Wilder Penfield taking sabbaticals where he collaborated with Santiago Ramón y Cajal. 

- James Lovelock spent a sabbatical living alone on the coast of England, where he developed his Gaia hypothesis. He found the solitude helped with creative thinking. 

- In the corporate world, Bill Gates reportedly takes annual "think weeks" away from Microsoft to contemplate the company's future. Samsung also instituted a sabbatical program to recharge executives.

- For non-profits and organizations, sabbaticals are encouraged as a way for leaders to prevent burnout and return with new skills or perspectives to improve the organization. Between World Wars I and II, US generals also took time for advanced study.

- Creative professionals like designer Stefan Sagmeister and chef Ferran Adrià use sabbaticals to avoid misery from staying in one field, finding variety and breaks help foster new ideas.
