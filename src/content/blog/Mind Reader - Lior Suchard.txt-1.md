 Here is a summary of the dedication in the book:

- The dedication is addressed to someone named Tal. 

- It expresses gratitude and appreciation for Tal, saying he fills the author with happy thoughts and that the author couldn't have done any of this without Tal. 

- It does not provide any additional contextual details about who Tal is or their relationship to the author.

 Here is a summary of the key points:

- The performer introduces himself as a mentalist who claims to have extremely focused mental abilities like a laser beam. He says it's a combination of a natural gift that he has developed over time.

- Being a mentalist also requires strong showmanship abilities to be entertaining. He says his performances are about 50% mental skills and 50% showmanship. 

- The passage then transitions to describing the opening of one of his shows. It sets the scene of him coming on stage to loud music and applause from a sold-out audience in Vegas. 

- He uses some playful mind reading demonstrations on audience members like guessing a number one man will say, to get the crowd engaged and start building a rapport. 

- The mentalist chooses a woman named Shirley from the audience to participate in a demonstration where she will secretly write down a name and hide it from him, to test his mind reading abilities. 

- The summary focuses on how the performer introduces himself and his claimed abilities, and provides a sense of the exciting, entertaining nature of one of his shows through describing the opening scene and initial demonstrations.

 

- The passage describes a performance by Israeli mentalist Lior Suchard. He engages in banter with a volunteer from the audience, Shirley, pretending to read her mind. 

- Suchard has Shirley write down a man's name secretly and then correctly guesses it is a man with a 4-letter name, "Andy". Shirley is amazed. 

- Suchard then has another volunteer, Blake, hold up a bill without touching it. He gives Blake a scroll to hold as well. 

- Suchard builds intrigue about the powers of the mind and how he has shaped his mind through extensive reading and practice to become a performer. 

- He says the real magic is transforming from a shy boy to an extrovert who can perform on stage. 

- Suchard promises to share secrets about harnessing the power of the mind through intuition, suggestion, and other methods. He gives an example experiment of sensory deprivation to demonstrate the mind's inherent creativity.

- In summary, the passage describes a performance of mentalism tricks and promises to share secrets about developing mental abilities through dedicated practice and understanding of psychology.

 

- The writer enjoyed exploring, climbing, and imagining as a child. They would often forget or lose their house keys, so they learned to break into their house by climbing a tree and jumping onto their bedroom window ledge. 

- They think they may have had ADHD or ADD as a child because they loved taking things apart to see how they worked, like a toy or even a television their father brought home. 

- One night at dinner when they were 6 years old, their spoon started moving on its own in their soup bowl. This was the first time their psychic abilities manifested. Their family saw it but weren't sure what to make of it.

- After this, the writer began experimenting with their abilities by trying to guess numbers and objects their brothers were thinking of. They became fascinated with learning about the human mind and practicing focusing their own mind. 

- Their feats got more complex over time as they combined skills. This also helped them overcome social anxiety by giving them something to focus on in conversations. Crowds would gather to watch their performances.

- Their mentalism skills became their career path and passion. They continue performing number guessing acts around the world today.

 

The passage describes the narrator's journey from a shy boy to a confident performer and mentalist. As a child, he was fascinated by Superman and felt most confident when performing magic tricks. He began doing shows for friends and local events from a young age. 

To promote himself, he would perform magic for customers at restaurants without charge. He also mailed clever letters to companies to drum up interest in his shows. These marketing techniques helped him build his reputation. 

In school, the narrator excelled in math and sciences but struggled in other subjects. He was able to improve some grades by using his mentalism skills, like predicting answers. His favorite teacher found a creative way to engage him by having him perform magic related to math lessons daily. 

After high school and mandatory military service, the narrator was fully committed to pursuing a career as a mentalist. He got a manager and worked tirelessly to perform anywhere possible. The passage suggests he was successful in achieving his childhood dream of becoming one of the best mentalists in the world.

 

- The author was invited to perform at a private party in Israel. While there, he was asked to help with marketing for a new cell phone being launched by the host, who owned a large telecommunications company. 

- At first the author was nervous about this new role promoting a product, which was outside his usual entertainment work. But he decided to prepare as best he could by learning about the industry and company.

- At a major trade show with 2000 people, the author successfully demonstrated the quality of the new cell phone by having randomly selected audience members try to make calls, showing that the phone being promoted worked well while others did not. This was a hit with the audience.

- Since then, the author has promoted many other products at trade shows through creative performances that tie the products into metaphorical concepts. 

- He was later a contestant on an Israeli reality TV show called "The Successor" hosted by famous mentalist Uri Geller, where he competed against other mentalists and was ultimately announced as the winner.

- This success increased his publicity but he says it was just a continuation of the hard work he had already been doing to become the best mentalist in the world.

So in summary, a chance request to help promote a new cell phone at a party launched the author into a new career in marketing products through entertaining performances at trade shows.

 

- The passage discusses the idea of a "sixth sense" and how the author believes they have developed certain mental skills and abilities through focused practice. 

- It talks about how the author uses mind reading, persuasion, and transferring energy in their performances. Some examples given include knowing someone's first love/teacher's name, bending objects, accurately predicting choices. 

- The author explains they do a combination of actual mind reading using clues as well as persuading/influencing people's thoughts and choices. 

- A specific example is described where the author gets a woman to think of a personal birth time and gets a man's watch to stop at the same time without anyone seeing it beforehand. 

- The author questions whether they truly read minds in this example or persuaded the thoughts, and how they knew the birth time would be meaningful. 

- In general, the passage explores the author's beliefs about developing mental abilities through focus and practice, and how they incorporate mind reading, persuasion and energy transfer into entertaining performances.

 Here are the key points summarized:

- Mentalism utilizes mind-reading, persuasion, and chi energy to project one's thoughts externally in a physical way. It demonstrates "mind over matter."

- The author believes that with practice, everyone can increase their mental abilities to some degree. 

- Placebos and self-fulfilling prophecies demonstrate the power of the mind over the body and mind over matter. Suggestions and beliefs can affect physical and mental states. 

- Advertising often uses subliminal messaging to influence the subconscious mind without conscious awareness. The author provides an example of how subliminal cues in a grocery store could influence cereal choice. 

- The author proposes a game using subliminal messaging through the first letters of sentences to try influencing the reader to visualize a specific shape combination. 

- Our brains can make sense of misspelled or jumbled words by focusing on overall word patterns rather than individual letters, demonstrating our minds' ability to decipher nonsense logically. 

- Mental shortcuts allow our brains to process information efficiently while coming to conclusions based on past experience rather than fully analyzing every detail.

 Here is a summary of the key points:

- The passage discusses how shortcuts and assumptions can lead our minds astray if we're not careful. It gives several examples where common words or patterns are missed due to mental shortcuts. 

- We rely on these shortcuts much of the time to process the huge amount of information our brains receive. But we must also remain vigilant and mindful, rather than operating purely on autopilot. 

- As a mentalist, the author aims to gain control over their mind and its natural tendencies, in order to consciously manipulate perceptions and influence others. 

- One example given is predicting a random number chosen by a participant from a phone book. Through staged randomness, the number is correctly guessed to demonstrate persuasion and aligned thinking. 

- The shortcut that leads us wrong is assuming our first perceptions are correct, without conscious thought or verification. We must tell our minds who is in charge to avoid being misled.

 

The section discusses techniques of persuasion and influence used in mentalism performances. It describes doing an "open prediction" where the mentalist predicts something that hasn't happened yet, like predicting the word a talk show host will choose. The mentalist claims this works through influencing or persuading the future, rather than reading it. 

It discusses getting audiences to like the performer and feel an emotional connection through techniques like humor, energy, and getting them involved from the start. Mirroring body language and mannerisms of others is introduced as a way to build rapport and persuasiveness. Neuro-linguistic programming and psychology of persuasion are mentioned as areas studied to understand how subtle communication cues can influence thoughts and behaviors. 

Examples are given of influencing people to think of the same number through priming or interruption. Visual illusions are used to demonstrate how expectations can be shaped. The ability to persuade is discussed as an important mentalist skill, though the exact methods are difficult to analyze step-by-step. The goal is to give a sense of basic persuasive elements used in performances.

 

- Mirroring is unconsciously copying another person's body language, facial expressions, words, etc. It creates a sense of connection and liking between people. 

- A study had interviewers subtly mirror half the participants' movements. Those participants later had more positive views of the product being discussed, showing mirroring influences attitudes. 

- Mirroring works because we feel comfortable with people like us. Copying another's mannerisms signals we "get" them on a subconscious level. 

- To build rapport, subtly mirror speech pace, tone, vocabulary of the other person. Over time the mirroring feels natural and enhances the conversation. 

- As a mind reader, the author creates emotional connections with audiences through techniques like open predictions that involve the whole group. This engages them in the act and builds anticipation and amazement when predictions come true. Mirroring body language of individuals in the audience also helps connect with them.

 Here is a summary of the key points from the passage:

- Body language provides important clues that mentalists can use to read people and influence them. The author analyzes audience members' body language before and during performances to choose effective volunteers. 

- Subtle cues like eye movements, posture, facial expressions and how people position their bodies can reveal emotions, honesty/dishonesty, and mental state. Researchers have shown people can identify emotions from just points of light showing body movements.

- In performances, the author pays close attention to volunteers' body language for clues to help with mentalism tricks like guessing hidden objects or first love names. Things like eye movements and body shielding give unconscious tells.

- Having people participate in group tricks adds psychological factors like competition and social pressure that intensify body language clues. The author uses these observational skills to consistently choose the right volunteers.

- Language also has power to influence and persuade when used skillfully. The author advocates actively thinking about word choices and their effects on people, rather than just speaking habitually.

The key message is that mentalists can gain insights into people's minds through carefully observing body language cues, both individually and in social settings, and using this channel of non-verbal communication to influence participants in performances. Attention to language details also enhances persuasive abilities.

 Here are some key points about persuasive language:

- Certain words like "because," "now," "please," and "thank you" tap into childhood memories and create emotional responses that make people more open to persuasion. 

- "Because" suggests logic and allows ideas to slide past critical thinking. Even irrational reasons following "because" can be persuasive. 

- "Now" implies urgency and gets people to take action immediately. 

- "Please" and "thank you" make people feel positively regarded, improving relationships and willingness to help.

- "Imagine" invites visualization and gets ideas to seem like they originated in the other person's mind. 

- The word "yes" has a positive ring, while the key is avoiding or reframing "no" responses through follow-up questions.  

- Reciprocity and implying owed favors ("I know you'd do the same for me") taps into our instinct to return favors and obligations.

In summary, certain linguistic framing techniques can subtly influence emotions and decision-making in a way that bypasses logical objections and makes people more open to persuasion. Timing words well is an effective soft persuasion strategy.

 

- The passage discusses persuasive techniques for influencing others, like using the principles of relative value and relative size to make less desirable options seem more reasonable by comparison. 

- It recommends employing techniques like asking questions that elicit yes responses to get someone in a pattern of agreeing, then asking the important question. 

- Physical cues like making eye contact 50% of the time, remembering and using someone's name, and having a powerful focused stare can help persuade others. 

- A story is told of a time during a performance where the mentalist chose someone to go play roulette with money given, but the person failed to realize the minimum bet and ruined that part of the show. The mentalist was still able to win back the audience with his reaction.

- Overall the passage gives advice on linguistic and psychological techniques to influence and persuade others in conversations and performances through relative comparisons, questioning patterns, eye contact, names and physical presence. It also shares a lesson about not fully predicting how others may respond.

 Here is a summary of the key events in the story:

- The narrator is a magician performing a show where he invites volunteers from the audience up on stage to participate in illusions and mind tricks. 

- He picks a couple, named Steve and Pam, and has them close their eyes while he lightly touches different body parts on Steve. Pam accurately says where she feels the touches. 

- It's revealed the narrator was actually touching Steve, not Pam directly, showing their "energy" was connected in some way. 

- For the next trick, the narrator pretends to hypnotize Steve while blindfolded. He then lightly jabs Pam in the butt with a fork while the audience claps. Steve jumps up surprised, showing he felt the touch too.

- It's played off as their "energy" remaining connected after the initial demonstration. The couple finds it hilarious and the audience loves the moment of surprise and connection between the volunteers. 

- The narrator closes by joking the painful sensation will last a month and their hypnotic connection lasts a week, getting one final laugh from the audience before concluding the show.

 Here is a summary of the key points in the passage:

- The passage introduces the concept of "chi" or "life force energy" that exists both inside and outside our bodies. It is the natural energy that makes up everything. 

- The performer is able to harness and direct chi energy through focusing their mind and intentions. They use chi energy to manipulate objects like bending spoons or making eyeglasses float through the air. 

- The performer can also transfer chi energy from one person to another to create sensations of touch without actual physical contact. This is done during demonstrations on stage with volunteers.

- Harnessing and projecting chi energy takes a lot of mental focus and effort. The performer works to build positive energy in the audience as well through their performances. 

- As the positive energy in the audience builds, it cycles back to energize the performer. Building emotional connections and persuading the audience to feel good emotions also influences the performer's ability to direct chi energy.

The key message is that the performer is able to perform mentalism tricks and demonstrations through harnessing and directing their "chi energy" or life force energy, both internally and to influence external objects and other people, aided by the positive energy from engaging audiences.

 

The performer draws energy from interacting with audiences during shows. This leaves them feeling very energized and creative afterwards, coming up with new ideas late at night. They try to leave audiences feeling positive as well. 

They believe in radiating positive energy wherever they go. They enjoy wowing people and making them laugh. Even skeptics usually say they enjoyed the show.

Their catchphrase is "Always think happy thoughts, as you never know who's reading them." They are a strong believer that our minds can affect the world, so we should channel energy positively. 

They share the story of Enzo Ferrari dismissing Ferruccio Lamborghini, which spurred Lamborghini to start his own successful car company. They say negative experiences can motivate positive action. 

As a mentalist, they focus on breathing properly to replenish chi energy. They believe our thoughts shape our reality, so we should think positively. Some people seem to attract negative situations due to negative mindsets, while others are perpetually positive and lucky. 

They work hard to maintain a positive energy and mindset for their own performances and to connect with audiences. Laughter is contagious but they try to balance humor with serious mental acts that require focus and energy levels. Overall, their goal is energizing audiences and encouraging positive thinking.

 

- The performer needs to maintain a careful level of energy and engagement from the audience during a show. Unexpected events like cell phones ringing can disrupt the flow. 

- Instead of getting upset, the performer incorporates ringing phones into the act by jokingly answering the call and guessing details about the caller. This keeps the energy positive.

- Mistakes during a performance can also dampen the mood, so the performer uses humor to acknowledge errors and get laughs from the audience. People are then more forgiving.

- Examples are provided where the performer pretends to get things wrong at first, before revealing the real trick that amazes the audience even more. This surges the positive energy higher. 

- The performer believes in always maintaining a positive, optimistic outlook. Even when things don't go as planned, failure is not an option according to their mindset. 

- Research suggests humans have an innate optimism bias hardwired in the brain. The performer discusses strategies like changing one's language, body language and facial expressions to consciously shift thoughts in a positive direction.

 

- Serotonin and other "happy hormones" get boosted when we have a positive mindset. This results from higher activity in the left prefrontal cortex of the brain, which handles positive emotions like optimism. 

- Unhappy emotions like anger, anxiety and depression show as higher activity in the right prefrontal cortex compared to the left. Happier people tend to have a higher left-to-right ratio in prefrontal cortex activity.

- Studies of Buddhist monks found extremely high left prefrontal cortex activity, attributed to their regular meditation practice. Meditation can positively shift brain activity patterns toward the left.

- Meditation involves focusing attention on breathing or other object to calm the mind. It provides benefits like feeling relaxed yet energized, with a clear and still mental state. 

- The author finds meditation centering and allows productive dialogue with himself. It shifts his worldview to be more positive, energetic and in control after even a short 10 minute session.

- Skeptics are not necessarily enemies but opportunities - the author enjoys proving them wrong and turning their negative energy positive through involving them in performances. He believes skepticism closes doors to possibilities.

- In one situation, political anti-Israel sentiment almost derailed a show but the author was able to defuse tensions and have a positive outcome through humor and an impromptu mind reading challenge.

 Here is a summary of the relevant parts:

- The passage discusses trusting one's intuition and gives examples of intuitive experiences like knowing something without conscious reasoning, sensing someone's distress, etc. 

- It says intuition allows awareness of wider information and communication to guide accurate predictions and choices. However, modern societies have lost touch with intuition by dismissing it as coincidence and focusing only on rational explanations. 

- The author says they have a natural intuitive ability they use to read minds by picking up on signals from the person's body language and mind, like images or feelings. It's like solving a puzzle or code by process of elimination. 

- Intuition plays a key role when they get mixed signals and have to go with their gut feeling to make a choice or decision about what they're sensing from the person. 

- Some statistics are given about apparent intuitive hunches that seemed to help people avoid danger, like the low occupancy of flights that crashed on 9/11 or the Titanic. 

- In the end, the passage shifts to discussing how the author has been hired to use their mentalist skills to give feedback on people in business meetings by intuiting things about them.

 

The passage describes a mentalist and their process for using intuition. They are hired to assess business proposals by reading the people making the presentations. 

At one meeting, they use their skills in body language reading and small talk to help the group relax. Afterwards, they analyze their notes and gut feelings. Their intuition tells them one of the six presenters is being dishonest, which may hurt the proposal. 

The mentalist believes intuition comes from carefully processing information with all five senses, then gaining further insight. They give examples of accurately predicting sports outcomes by thoroughly researching the teams and players, then following their intuition. 

Developing one's intuition requires believing in it, meditating, being open-minded, questioning decisions, listening to one's body, noting when intuition is correct, and being patient. The mentalist sometimes changes performances based on new intuitive insights about skeptics or spectators.

 

The passage describes how the mentalist uses intuition both in their performances and personal decisions. As a new mentalist, they learned to first confirm guesses with guests to avoid appearing wrong. Over time, they developed skills to use intuition to determine who would be honest and strategic in interactions. 

Intuition also guides important career decisions, like choosing a last-minute high-profile performance over existing commitments. Though initially confusing, intuition led to new opportunities. On another occasion, intuition suggested turning down a lucrative New Year's Eve show, which didn't clearly pay off but felt right. 

The mentalist believes intuition improves with practice. They provide exercises like a "red light, green light" game and "blind reading" with index cards to develop intuitive skills. 

In the final story, during a performance the mentalist has a participant hold a bill and scroll without touching either. Through intuition, the mentalist correctly wrote the participant's bill serial number on the scroll beforehand, amazing the audience.

 

- The mentalist was driving to a private performance when he had a series of mishaps like missing an appointment and losing his hotel key. 

- When parking, he left his car keys inside the locked car without realizing. 

- However, his performance went flawlessly, showing he was able to fully engage and focus his mind. 

- He argues we don't always use our full brain power, sometimes acting on autopilot without consciously thinking. But with focus we can tap into our brain's full capacity. 

- He gives an example of insisting a visa clerk take a closer look at his documents, rather than rejecting them without proper thought. This shows the importance of actively engaging the mind rather than acting on assumptions.

- The story illustrates how focused thinking allows us to use our full mental abilities, while lack of focus results in only partial brain engagement and potential mistakes.

 

The author tried to get a document stamped but noticed the expiration date of 2006 was before the issuing date of 2007. When he pointed this out to the woman checking the document, she refused to acknowledge there was an error and wouldn't explain the discrepancy. 

The author believes people don't use their creativity and critical thinking enough. They just follow rigid rules without examining anomalies. He admires Leonardo da Vinci for his multifaceted genius and using his full mental capacity. 

As a mentalist, the author is constantly coming up with new acts and routines to stay fresh. For an appearance on The Tonight Show, he wanted to do something different when predicting the word Kim Kardashian would choose from newspapers. He had a shirt made saying he thought she would choose "Summer" as a creative twist. 

The author believes continuously learning new skills and practicing routines helps strengthen our brains by forming new neural connections. Small activities like using our non-dominant hand can provide mental boosts. Continued deliberate practice of a skill over time also builds our abilities in focused areas. He applies this to constantly improving his mentalist performances.

 Here is a summary of the highlighted paragraph:

The paragraph discusses using memory techniques like the Peg System to help remember lists. It explains how the Peg System works - you first memorize "peg words" like gun, shoe, tree, etc. and associate each item on your list with a peg word to create a vivid mental picture. For example, to remember notepad, pencil, spoon, you could imagine shooting a notepad with a gun, pencils pouring out of a shoe, and spoons raining from a tree. By creating exaggerated mental images that combine each item with its peg word, it helps you remember the items on the list. The technique works because it creates strong associations in your memory.

 

- The passage discusses how the two hemispheres of the brain (left and right) work together to interpret complex social and emotional situations. 

- Through an example of a friend asking for ice in an angry tone, it shows how the left hemisphere processes words literally, while the right hemisphere picks up on prosody, emotions, and body language. 

- When the hemispheres work together, we can intuitively understand situations beyond just the literal meaning. 

- The author notes that during their mentalism act and brainstorming, they consciously draw on both hemispheres - rehearsing content logically but being spontaneous creatively. They toggle between focusing on details and the whole perspective. 

- Most people rely more on left-brain logical thinking, but we need to engage the intuitive, creative right brain more through lateral thinking challenges. 

- Several "thinking outside the box" problems are presented to illustrate this, like solving a flat tire issue when the rental company's strict policy prevents the usual solution. 

- Developing whole-brain thinking allows for more flexible, creative problem solving in complex real-world scenarios.

 

The passage discusses the importance of whole-brain or creative thinking in problem-solving and innovation. It argues that relying solely on logical, analytical left-brain thinking is no longer sufficient. Companies now need employees who can tap into both logical and creative/artistic right-brain skills. 

Some examples provided include how tech companies like Apple and Google deliberately design products to appeal to both functional and aesthetic sensibilities. Their work environments also aim to nurture creativity by allowing play, exploration and flexibility. The story of how Ray Kroc turned McDonald's into a franchise by creatively envisioning its growth potential is given as another example of thinking outside the box.

Overall, the passage advocates developing skills associated with both hemispheres of the brain to come up with novel solutions, seize new opportunities, and thrive in today's business environment which values innovation and inventiveness in addition to analysis. Fostering a culture where whole-brain thinking is supported seems key to success according to the examples.

 

- Scientists receive grants between $10,000 to $100,000 from a funding organization. 

- The scientists use this money to hire extra staff and purchase new equipment for their research projects. 

- This gives the scientists more resources to further their work and take on new projects. The funding is meant to support scientific innovation and progress.

 

The passage describes a performance by a mentalist that amazed and wowed the audience. Faces in the crowd were laughing, talking excitedly and expressing disbelief at what they were witnessing. People were shouting things like "no, that's impossible!" and repeating "oh my god" over and over in astonishment. Everyone was shaking their heads in disbelief and asking how the performer did what they just saw. The positive energy from the audience was radiating from their expressions and reactions. The passage notes the performer is happy about eliciting this response, as using persuasion and amazement is what they do. It says now that the audience has experienced a sample of the performer's abilities through this, they too can see they have some of the same mind reading skills. The piece is signed off by the performer, saying to always think happy thoughts.
