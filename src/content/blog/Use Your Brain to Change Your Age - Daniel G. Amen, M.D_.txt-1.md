 Here is a summary of the praise and endorsements for Dr. Daniel Amen's book "Use Your Brain to Change Your Age":

- Barry Sears, author of The Zone, praises the book for distilling Dr. Amen's previous work into a comprehensive yet easy to follow lifestyle program backed by complex science. 

- Michael Gurian finds the book inspiring and practical, emphasizing its case studies and their ability to motivate readers to improve their lives. 

- Hyla Cass calls it an essential guide to reclaiming your brain and life, recommending it to anyone.

- Ingrid Kohlstadt notes it offers hope and motivation, arguing the fountain of youth is between your ears as Dr. Amen proposes. 

- Earl Henslin says the book is powerfully impactful for improving quality and length of life. 

- Joseph Maroon, a neurosurgeon, found it to be the best user's guide to optimal brain function. 

- Andrew Newberg praised the outstanding, practical advice based on what's known about how the brain and body work, calling the information tremendously important. 

- Stephen Covey also recommends Dr. Amen's books for avoiding diseases like obesity, depression and Alzheimer's.

 

SPECT scans can show brain activity levels - areas that are highly active, moderately active, or low in activity. A healthy brain scan shows even and symmetrical activity across the brain. SPECT scans of three 60-year-old patients are examined - one with a normal brain, one with Alzheimer's disease, and one who is overweight with sleep apnea. Their scans show differences in brain activity levels. 

The passage discusses how lifestyle choices like diet, stress, sleep, substance use, and environmental toxins can negatively impact brain aging over time. However, some older patients in their 80s still show healthy brain scans due to lifelong brain-healthy habits. Seven principles of changing the brain from the Amen Clinics are summarized, focusing on optimizing brain function through diet, exercise, stress management, cognitive stimulation, social engagement, spirituality, and avoiding toxins. An example patient, Carlos, who followed the program and improved his brain scan and health outcomes is also briefly described.

 

The passage discusses the importance of brain health and how it impacts various aspects of life. A healthy brain leads to better outcomes like being happier, healthier, wealthier, wiser and more effective. It allows you to make better decisions that help you live longer. 

An unhealthy brain has opposite effects - it can make you sadder, sicker, poorer, less wise and less effective. You're more likely to make bad decisions. 

It then provides details on the complexity of the brain and how vulnerable it is to damage and aging. Several factors that accelerate brain aging are discussed like toxins, inflammation, injuries, medical issues, an unhealthy diet, lack of exercise, stress and more. 

Conversely, behaviors that can decelerate brain aging and help you have a younger, healthier brain include avoiding the bad factors above, having a healthy social support system, protecting your DNA, learning new things, finding purpose and meaning, getting proper medical care, supplementation and monitoring your brain health. 

While avoiding harmful behaviors, the passage argues one can still have fun by making better decisions that lead to more opportunities like relationships, education, careers and longer life overall with a healthy brain.

 Here is a summary of the behaviors recommended to live a long time with an intact brain:

- Make good, conscientious decisions. Thoughtful decision-making is closely linked to longevity. 

- Surround yourself with a positive, healthy support system of friends and family. 

- Protect your brain from injuries. 

- Limit your exposure to toxins in your surroundings. 

- Limit alcohol consumption to no more than 4 drinks per week. 

- Protect yourself from excessive oxidative stress. 

- Maintain healthy DNA repair mechanisms and telomere length through foods/supplements like fish oil, multivitamins, green tea.

- Maintain physical health by keeping inflammation low, avoiding gum/intestinal issues, and maintaining nutrient and hormone levels. 

- Engage in regular exercise, including endurance and strength training. 

- Get quality sleep of 7-8 hours per night. 

- Maintain a healthy weight and diet. 

- Continue lifelong learning and mental stimulation. 

- Practice stress management techniques like meditation. 

- Promote good mental health and avoid severe anxiety or depression. 

- Consider brain rehabilitation strategies and supplements as needed. 

- Develop a sense of meaning and purpose. 

- Monitor your brain health through scans when appropriate.

 

- Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia are major health concerns, especially as the population ages. There is no cure yet.

- Symptoms often don't appear until later stages, but brain changes may start 30+ years earlier. Early screening and intervention are important. 

- Stages of Alzheimer's have been revised to include a preclinical stage where there are no outward symptoms but brain changes have started. 

- Risk factors include brain injuries, substance abuse, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, toxins, and more. 

- Lifestyle changes like diet, exercise, learning, social connection, and managing stress/depression can help reduce risks. 

- Screening numbers can help detect problems early. Ignoring health issues may lead to earlier death or memory/cognitive problems.

- Stories are used to illustrate how making healthy changes can dramatically improve brain function, memory, decision-making and quality of life even in more advanced cases. Early intervention is emphasized.

 

- Lisa noticed changes in her grandmother (Nana) around age 65 - fewer jokes/stories, irritability, forgetting things. 

- Nana was diagnosed with diabetes and high blood pressure. Over time she got increasingly confused and lost. 

- The family finally took Nana to a doctor who diagnosed senile dementia. She moved to a nursing home. 

- Lisa felt sad watching Nana decline and not recognize her. She wondered if the same would happen to her mother.

- Years later, Lisa started noticing similar changes in her mother Ruth around age 68 - word finding difficulties, memory issues, getting lost. 

- Initially Lisa's father dismissed it as normal aging, but Lisa insisted on getting Ruth evaluated due to concerns about early Alzheimer's.  

- Ruth had brain scans and tests at the Amen Clinics that showed signs of early Alzheimer's disease - decreased activity in areas involved in memory, direction, and visual memory. 

- Lisa was relieved to get an early diagnosis so Ruth could get treatment, unlike what happened with Nana who was not diagnosed until later stages.

 

- The waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) is considered a better measure of health risks than BMI alone, as carrying excess weight around the abdomen is more metabolically harmful. A healthy WHtR is less than half one's height. 

- Accurately measuring one's waist circumference is important, as clothing sizes can be misleading. Two case studies highlighted large discrepancies between self-reported and actual waist sizes.

- Knowing daily calorie needs and intake is critical for weight management. Tracking calories via journaling helps increase awareness. 

- Eating 5-10 servings of fruits and vegetables daily provides nutrition and filling fiber to help control calories.

- Getting 7-8 hours of sleep nightly is important for brain and overall health. Sleep apnea screening may be warranted.

- Key lab values to know include blood pressure, blood sugar markers like A1C, and vitamin D level, as various biomarkers outside normal ranges increase health risks. 

- For the case of Ruth, addressing high blood sugar, low vitamin D, and sleep issues through diet, supplements and lifestyle changes was seen as important for improving her cognitive symptoms. Overall monitoring of multiple health metrics was deemed important for her "brain rehabilitation program".

 

- Have your vitamin D, thyroid, C-reactive protein, homocysteine, ferritin, lipid panel, folic acid, B12, testosterone, and APOE levels tested. Maintain healthy ranges for these values. 

- Ruth's vitamin D, C-reactive protein, homocysteine, and testosterone levels were low/high and needed to be optimized. Her other levels were normal. 

- Getting sunshine, taking a vitamin D supplement, following an anti-inflammatory diet, taking B vitamins and fish oil can help optimize problematic levels. 

- Abnormal thyroid, inflammation, homocysteine, iron, cholesterol and hormone levels are common causes of cognitive issues. Treating any imbalances can improve symptoms.

- Knowing your APOE genotype provides information on genetic dementia risk. The e4 variant significantly increases Alzheimer's risk. However, not all e4 carriers will develop the disease.

- Screening for syphilis, HIV and other infections is important to rule out infectious causes of cognitive decline. Ruth's tests for these were negative.

 

- Ruth had a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, as she had the APOE e4 gene, which increases her risk. The odds that she would develop Alzheimer's due to this gene are estimated at 99%. 

- Ruth was already showing signs of early Alzheimer's disease based on her clinical evaluation, brain scan findings, and poor memory test performance. 

- Ruth had 10 out of the 12 most important modifiable health risk factors for early death. These included things like being overweight, physical inactivity, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, and low intake of fruits and vegetables. Addressing these risk factors was seen as critical to slowing the progression of her Alzheimer's.

- Ruth was given a treatment plan to modify her diet, increase exercise and supplements, improve sleep, and optimize her other risk factors. Three months later, her memory and other metrics had improved significantly in response to these lifestyle changes, without needing medications. 

- The case highlights the importance of knowing one's risk factors for Alzheimer's, getting brain scans, and actively working to modify risks through lifestyle in order to potentially delay or reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease progression. Early intervention seems to have benefited Ruth compared to waiting until symptoms were more advanced.

 

- Candace was worried about her husband Ed's declining mood, judgment and memory. When she reviewed his finances, she noticed he had paid some bills twice and forgot others.

- Ed's doctor diagnosed him with Alzheimer's disease without doing any brain scans. Candace was unhappy with this lack of thoroughness. 

- When Candace brought Ed to Dr. Daniel Amen for a brain SPECT scan, it showed large ventricles and a small cerebellum - not the typical Alzheimer's pattern. This pattern is often seen with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH).

- NPH was never considered by Ed's original doctor because he did not have the usual symptoms of NPH like urinary incontinence or trouble walking. 

- With the SPECT results, Dr. Amen recommended a neurosurgery consultation. The surgeon agreed and placed a shunt in Ed's brain. Within 3 weeks Ed's memory returned dramatically.

- This case shows the importance of thorough evaluation including brain imaging rather than just making a diagnosis without looking at the brain directly. Proper diagnosis can lead to effective treatment.

- Early prevention is key to reducing Alzheimer's risk factors like family history, head injuries, lifestyle factors, depression, diabetes, etc. Starting prevention strategies as early as possible is important.

 Here is a summary of the key points from the article:

- The article provides 20 tips for maintaining brain health and longevity. It focuses on lifestyle factors like diet, exercise, sleep, and maintaining optimal health metrics.

- It emphasizes the importance of knowing key health numbers like BMI, blood pressure, blood sugar, vitamin levels, thyroid and inflammation levels. Regular testing is recommended to monitor these. 

- A healthy diet of fruits, vegetables, whole foods and anti-inflammatory omega-3 fats is promoted to reduce inflammation and risk of diseases. 

- Getting adequate sleep of 8 hours per night is linked to better cognitive function. Issues like sleep apnea should also be addressed. 

- Other lifestyle behaviors discussed include not smoking, limiting alcohol, and engaging in regular physical activity. 

- Memory screenings after age 50 are advised to catch any cognitive issues early. Risk factors for Alzheimer's like diabetes and heart disease should be reduced.

- The article notes that lifestyle choices not only impact one's own health but can potentially affect generations to come by influencing epigenetic factors. Both positive and negative health impacts can be intergenerational.

- In summary, the 20 tips provide a holistic framework focusing on both lifestyle and metabolic health metrics to promote brain health, longevity and reduced disease risk. Regular monitoring and prevention of risk factors is emphasized.

 

- Tamara was suffering from various health issues like chronic diarrhea, bloating, weight gain, etc. Tests showed high blood pressure, cholesterol, triglycerides, and low vitamin D. 

- Her doctor prescribed medications but Tamara was hesitant due to past issues getting off other medications. 

- Her sister Tana, who had overcome food allergies, suspected Tamara might have undiagnosed food allergies and put her on an "elimination diet" eating like a gorilla - greens, proteins, water. 

- Within two days Tamara had her first normal bowel movement in months. Two months later she lost 17 pounds and all her biomarkers improved dramatically. 

- When Tamara shared this with her doctor, the doctor did not acknowledge the improvement and said she still needed lifelong medication. 

- Following Tana's guidance, Tamara continued without medication and kept improving her health over the next month. 

- Through diet changes, Tamara significantly turned her health around, lost weight, gained energy, and inspired positive changes in her family and friends as well. The future is bright for maintaining her health through continued lifestyle changes.

 

- The passage discusses dispelling various common lies and excuses people tell themselves for not eating healthy or making poor food choices. It provides counterarguments for each excuse. 

- It emphasizes that our nutrition directly impacts our health and that food is either "medicine or poison" for our bodies. Our genes are not destiny - our behaviors can influence gene expression. 

- Some key tips provided include eating high quality calories in moderate amounts, drinking water and avoiding liquid calories, eating lean proteins and fiber-rich carbs, limiting unhealthy fats, and using herbs/spices for cooking. 

- It stresses taking personal responsibility for one's diet instead of blaming others. Cheat days are discouraged as they can trigger addictive behaviors related to unhealthy foods. 

- The overall message is that making smarter choices with our nutrition can significantly improve our health, longevity, mood, energy levels and more. A healthy diet is portrayed as an investment that pays off over the long run.

 

- Drinking your calories can significantly increase your calorie intake and negatively impact longevity. Eliminating most drink calories is a simple strategy for calorie control. 

- Staying hydrated is important for good nutrition, mood, cognition, skin health and more. Water mixed with lemon juice and stevia is a tasty and low-calorie drink option. 

- Consuming high-quality lean protein at meals helps balance blood sugar, support brain health, mood and focus. Good sources include fish, poultry, meat, beans, nuts and high-protein vegetables. 

- Eat "smart" or low-glycemic, high-fiber carbohydrates like whole grains, vegetables and fruits. These don't spike blood sugar as much as refined carbs. The glycemic index rates carb impact on blood sugar. 

- Choosing foods with a low glycemic index and high fiber content supports weight control, diabetes management and longevity by stabilizing blood sugar and reducing cravings.

 

- Eating fiber helps you feel full longer and prevents blood sugar spikes, which can lead to weight loss over time and reduced diabetes risk. Experts recommend 25-35g of fiber per day but most people consume far less. 

- High-fiber foods provide many health benefits like reducing cholesterol, improving digestion, lowering blood pressure and reducing cancer risk. Some high-fiber foods include beans, lentils, fruits and vegetables. 

- It's important to limit added sugars and refined carbohydrates as they areempty calories that can promote weight gain and addictive behaviors. Sugar is linked to inflammation and health issues. 

- Healthy fats like Omega-3s found in salmon, walnuts and avocados are important for brain and heart health. Low Omega-3 levels are associated with depression, obesity and other issues. 

- Eating a variety of colorful fruits and vegetables boosts antioxidant intake, which protects brain health and function by reducing inflammation and cognitive decline risks. Blueberries in particular support brain health in studies.

- Unhealthy fats like saturated and trans fats from processed foods should be limited as they contribute to weight gain and cognitive issues over time. Following these evidence-based dietary guidelines can promote longer-term weight control and brain health.

 

- Studies show that a diet rich in blueberries can lose abdominal fat, lower cholesterol, and improve glucose levels. Similar effects were found for rats that consumed strawberries and spinach. 

- The Mediterranean diet, which includes fruits and vegetables from many colors, fish, legumes, nuts, is associated with reduced risk of depression and dementia as well as cognitive decline. 

- High antioxidant fruits and vegetables include acai berries, avocados, beets, blackberries, blueberries, broccoli, cherries, cranberries, kiwis, oranges, plums, pomegranates, raspberries, red grapes, red bell peppers, spinach, and strawberries. 

- Brain-healthy herbs and spices that can boost flavor without added salt include turmeric, saffron, sage, cinnamon, basil, thyme, oregano, garlic, ginger, and rosemary. 

- Other tips for brain health are limiting caffeine, eating super antioxidant-rich foods like berries and apples, reducing salt intake, and increasing potassium through foods like bananas and oranges.

 

The passage discusses snacking, food allergies, hormones/organics/safe lists, and brain healthy eating on a budget. It suggests snacking every 2.5-3 hours with low-calorie foods balancing protein, carbs and fats. Common food allergens include dairy, eggs, peanuts, soy, wheat and shellfish. It lists the "dirty dozen" most contaminated fruits/veggies and least contaminated. It recommends choosing organic, hormone-free foods and eating fish lower in mercury like salmon. Tips for brain healthy eating on a budget include freezing extra foods before they spoil, buying in season, shopping sales, raising backyard chickens, and learning proper food storage.

 

- Riz Malik was overweight and had an unhealthy diet, eating lots of fast food and sugary drinks every day. He craved burgers, curries, and bread. 

- After seeing a friend diagnosed with high cholesterol and blood pressure, Riz evaluated his own health and realized his diet was poor and leading to issues like acid reflux.

- Riz started following the nutrition tips from Daniel Amen's books. He ditched sodas, ate more fruits/veggies, fish oil, and did light exercise daily. 

- After 4 months, Riz lost 40 pounds, his waist shrank 6 inches, BMI dropped, and his acid reflux resolved. His energy, sleep, and work improved.

- Riz got blood tests after weight loss which showed huge improvements - cholesterol down, LDL/triglycerides down, blood sugar/HBA1c normal. Even his family history risk factors like blood pressure normalized. 

- Riz felt confident sharing his success story and encouraging patients to optimize their health and weight for high self-esteem. The lifestyle changes made him healthier internally and externally.

 

- Andy McGill had his brain scanned after attending one of Dr. Amen's presentations about ADHD and brain SPECT imaging. His high school daughter Katy was struggling with ADHD. 

- Andy's brain scan results were alarming - it showed overall decreased activity in a "Swiss cheese" toxic-looking pattern, which can be caused by factors like alcohol, drugs, infections, lack of oxygen, or medical problems. 

- When asked, Andy described having a couple drinks to wind down after work, wine with dinner, and a nightcap most nights - a minimum of about 4 drinks per day. He had been drinking this amount for over 30 years since his newspaper journalism career.

- Dr. Amen told Andy his brain looked much older than his age due to the drinking and recommended he stop completely. Andy committed to sobriety and changed his lifestyle with diet, exercise and supplements to support his brain health. 

- Over the next few years, repeat scans showed significant improvement and rejuvenation in Andy's brain as he maintained his healthy lifestyle changes. His story shows how making positive changes can help reverse damage from previous unhealthy habits.

 

- Andy saw a neuropsychiatrist named Dr. Amen about concerns over his drinking and brain health in the late 1990s. Brain scans showed decreased activity that was likely due to years of heavy drinking. 

- Dr. Amen warned Andy that if he continued drinking, he would face health issues like dementia. He urged Andy to stop drinking and overhaul his diet and exercise habits.

- It took Andy over a year to fully commit to quitting alcohol. On New Year's Eve 2000, he vowed to stop drinking for good after finishing one last glass of wine. 

- In addition to no longer drinking, Andy gave up caffeine and started a daily exercise routine of running on a treadmill for an hour each morning. He also lost over 100 pounds through diet and exercise.

- Follow-up brain scans in 2010 showed dramatic improvement in brain activity, looking much younger than scans from a decade prior. Andy's lifestyle changes successfully reversed the effects of years of heavy drinking and poor health habits.

- Today in his 70s, Andy maintains an extremely high level of cardiovascular fitness through daily morning exercise. His brain and body are decades younger than his actual age due to his commitment to healthy living.

 

1. Seeing your own brain through imaging can motivate people to better care for their brain by starting healthy habits. 

2. Alcohol is not good for the brain or body, especially in large quantities. It's better to reduce or quit drinking to improve brain and body health over time.

3. Regular exercise makes a big difference in appearance and feeling. It improves cardiovascular health, reduces risks of disease, and benefits the brain. 

4. Dedicating to lifelong brain-healthy habits like exercise leads to better overall health and longevity. Physical activity increases memory, thinking, mood, and protects against cognitive decline. Exercise also promotes stress management, better sleep, circulation and growth of new brain cells through BDNF. Maintaining an active lifestyle is important for optimal brain function at any age.

 Here is a summary of the key points about physical activity and brain health across the lifespan:

- Physical activity as a teenager is associated with the lowest risk of later cognitive impairment. However, physical activity at any age is correlated with reduced cognitive decline. This indicates it's never too late to start an exercise program. 

- Exercise strengthens the brain and enhances its ability to resist damage from brain injuries. Even mild traumatic brain injuries can impact executive function and increase risk of unhealthy behaviors by disrupting neurochemistry. 

- Aerobic exercise, activities requiring coordination, and resistance training all benefit the brain. Burst/interval training and coordination sports like dancing or tennis provide additional benefits by activating the cerebellum which supports decision-making. 

- Mindful activities like yoga and tai chi can boost the brain and support mental health by reducing anxiety and depression and improving focus, even without generating as many new brain cells as aerobic exercise. 

- In summary, regular physical activity at any stage of life, including aerobic exercise, coordination activities and strength training, supports brain health and cognitive function as we age. It's never too late to start an exercise routine for brain and mental health benefits.

 

- Dancing can be an effective treatment for depression according to recent studies. Salsa or tango dancing helped lift moods in depressed patients due to the exercise, social interaction, mindfulness required in learning new dances. 

- Tango dancers in one study had lower stress hormones and higher testosterone levels. They also felt sexier and more relaxed. 

- Another study showed tango lessons significantly lowered depression levels compared to a control group, similar to effects from meditation lessons. Dance demands extreme focus which interrupts negative thought patterns linked to anxiety and depression. 

- Physical, rhythmic movement in dance opens up body posture from a curled back position to an optimistic, open stance. This also positively impacts mood. 

- To achieve life-changing decisions with no turning back or slip-ups, it's important to get one's intention, focus and will perfectly aligned, as Dr. Joe Dispenza discusses. This requires observing thoughts, visualizing new habits, feeding the brain new experiences to wire in new neural networks, studying role models, and reaching a state of firm intention with conviction to change. 

- Physical activity can help shrinkage of the brain associated with Alzheimer's disease, as studies by Dr. Cyrus Raji at the University of Pittsburgh have shown.

 

- Cyrus' grandmother was a brilliant teacher who spoke 5 languages, but suffered from strokes and eventually dementia/Alzheimer's. Watching her mental decline inspired Cyrus' research in this field.

- Dr. Raji has conducted brain imaging and Alzheimer's research for 7 years, focusing the last 5 on how lifestyle affects the brain. Brain scans can measure overall and regional brain volumes, which shrink with age and disease. 

- A study by Dr. Raji found higher obesity was linked to lower brain volumes and higher Alzheimer's risk. Being overweight led to some shrinkage while being at a healthy weight showed no shrinkage. 

- Dr. Raji then studied the effects of physical activity like walking. Studies found walking just 1 mile/day preserved brain volumes in memory/learning areas and reduced Alzheimer's risk by 50% over 13 years. 

- Another study found walking just 5 miles/week (3/4 mile/day) preserved brain volumes in people with mild cognitive impairment, reducing further shrinkage even in obese participants. Physical activity improves brain blood flow and nutrition.

So in summary, Dr. Raji's research shows how lifestyle factors like obesity and physical inactivity can negatively impact brain volumes and Alzheimer's risk, while regular walking can help preserve brain volumes and reduce risk even in at-risk groups.

 

- Jose was a serial cheater who had trouble controlling his impulsive behaviors like infidelity and adrenaline-seeking activities. 

- Brain scanning revealed three abnormalities - increased activity in the anterior cingulate indicating compulsive behavior, decreased activity in the prefrontal cortex indicating impaired self-control, and signs of prior brain injuries. 

- Initially Jose denied any head injuries, but eventually admitted to a history of concussions from football and multiple hits to the head from bull riding and mixed martial arts. 

- Brain injuries, especially repetitive head trauma, can damage the prefrontal cortex which helps regulate impulses and decision making. This likely contributed to Jose's inability to control his compulsive cheating and risk-taking behaviors. 

- Optimizing brain functioning through treatments like neurofeedback can help strengthen the prefrontal cortex and improve self-regulation of behaviors driven by other brain regions like the anterior cingulate. This was presented as a way for Jose to potentially gain better control over his impulses.

 

- Jose admits to using his head to break things as a party trick when drunk, putting dents in walls and doors to find studs. 

- The psychiatrist thinks to himself "This is not a sign of intelligent life" but doesn't say it aloud. When Jose adds more details, the psychiatrist inadvertently says it out loud. 

- Jose agrees his past behavior was not a sign of intelligence. 

- Jose and his wife Angela appear on a Dr. Phil show where brain scans reveal brain damage in Jose. Jose hopes this can help change his behavior rather than be an excuse. 

- The psychiatrist treats Jose, emphasizing lifestyle changes like diet, sleep, supplements to improve brain function. Jose makes progress over 7 months as shown by a follow-up brain scan. 

- Jose resists a risky cliff jump in Hawaii, realizing the consequences, in a dramatic change from his past behavior. 

- The psychiatrist concludes Jose has literally changed his brain for the better through treatment and lifestyle changes. Conscientiousness is associated with longevity in a long-term study.

 

- The study does not show that pessimists live longer than optimists. Rather, carefree optimists who don't worry or plan for the future do not live as long. 

- Thoughtful planning, perseverance, and good brain function are associated with longevity. Prudent achievers with stable support systems lived longer. 

- Healthy habits like exercise, routines, and social networks promote longevity. Social relationships greatly impact health. 

- Moderate worry and thinking about the future are important for health. Too little or too much anxiety is problematic. 

- Conscientious people who "finish what they start" have a reduced risk of Alzheimer's. Self-discipline is protective of brain health. 

- The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is important for decision making, impulse control, and learning from mistakes. Taking care of PFC health promotes longevity. 

- Being overweight can decrease PFC function and blood flow, since the PFC regulates judgment and decision making. Obesity is linked to many health issues. 

- ADHD, which is associated with low PFC activity, may pose longevity risks if not properly managed as some carefree optimism does. Overall health of the PFC promotes longevity.

 

- ADHD is characterized by short attention span, distractibility, disorganization, hyperactivity, and poor impulse control. People with ADHD often have trouble with time management and excitement/conflict-seeking behaviors. 

- Untreated ADHD is associated with higher risks of substance abuse, relationship problems, academic/job failure, medical issues, obesity, depression, and lack of conscientiousness due to impulsivity issues.

- The book argues ADHD may increase Alzheimer's risk due to its connections to illnesses like alcohol abuse, obesity, depression, and head injuries that are Alzheimer's risk factors. 

- Natural ADHD treatments include exercise, diet, supplements like fish oil, or medication to enhance prefrontal cortex function and impulse control. 

- Conscientiousness involves impulse control and consideration of consequences. It can change over time and is important for health and longevity. 

- Tips to boost conscientiousness include practicing self-control, protecting the brain, getting sleep, maintaining blood sugar, taking fish oil, having goals and checking behavior against them daily. This helps strengthen the prefrontal cortex and reign in impulsive tendencies.

 

- Practicing self-control and saying no to unhealthy temptations helps strengthen the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and develop willpower over time. Good parenting involves teaching children self-control by not giving in to tantrums. 

- Mental illnesses like ADD, anxiety and depression can decrease self-control. Getting treatment for these issues is important for being in control of one's life. Factors like poor sleep, nutrition and brain chemistry fluctuations also make self-control more difficult.

- Jim Kwik struggled in college initially but discovered techniques to improve brain function and processing speed out of desperation. He now teaches corporations and others worldwide how to boost brain longevity, speed and memory through mental workouts and lifelong learning strategies. Optimizing physical brain health is the foundation, followed by continued mental stimulation.

- Making thoughtful, conscientious decisions that consider long-term consequences is important for longevity. Factors like addictions, head injuries, stress, unstable routines, poverty and low IQ negatively impact decision making abilities. Enhancing prefrontal cortex blood flow through lifestyle can counter these effects.

 

The passage discusses Jim's experience with information overload and exhaustion as a student trying to learn everything as fast as possible. He ended up in the hospital after neglecting sleep and food. inspired by a quote from Einstein, Jim realized he needed to learn smarter, not just work harder. 

He began studying techniques for improving memory, focus, and learning abilities. Some key tips included reading regularly to exercise the brain, listening to audiobooks, journaling, maintaining curiosity like a child, exercising to stimulate the brain, and creating a positive learning environment. 

Specific memory techniques are also outlined, called the SUAVE method. It involves saying the person's name, using it in conversation, asking questions about it, visualizing a crazy image to remember it by, and ending conversations using their name. Practicing this for 21 days can establish a stronger habit. 

Speed reading is also discussed. Jim shares that it is a skill that can be learned with practice, but may require slowing down at first to relearn reading in a new way before accelerating. The passage provides an overview of Jim's experience with information overload and his realizations about learning smarter through various brain training techniques.

 

- The passage uses the metaphor of an elephant (emotions/limbic system) and rider (thinking/prefrontal cortex) to represent the two main forces in the brain that can be in conflict. 

- Brain training techniques can help sync up the elephant and rider so they work together instead of fighting for control. The Amen Clinics developed an online "Brain Gym" with personalized exercises to optimize brain function as a whole system.

- The default mode of the brain focuses more on negativity due to evolutionary survival reasons, but we can train it to spiral into positivity instead through consciously directing thoughts and attention. 

- External triggers automatically generate emotional responses, but we have control over our feelings and conscious thoughts. By focusing on positive thoughts and relaxation techniques, we can influence the initial emotional response. 

- Over time, making the positivity response habitual can reshape moods, behaviors, and even personality from one prone to fear and worries into a happier, calmer, more productive orientation.

 Here is a summary of the key points about short term and long term benefits of brain training:

Short term benefits:
- Improves memory, attention, emotional intelligence and reduces stress within a week of starting brain training games. 

- Enhances focus, positive thinking and calm responses to challenges by practicing preventative mental health techniques. 

- Keeps the brain "tuned up" so automatic responses to stressors are more positive and productive. 

Long term benefits: 
- If a crisis occurs later in life, the brain will be better trained to deal with stress effectively due to regular brain workouts. 

- Positive and helpful reactions will become habitual, making it harder to fall into unproductive negative patterns of thinking. 

- Actions and behaviors will better align with internal values and convictions over time through brain training.

- Brain training may help with coping after loss or difficulties and allow one to be more resilient and supportive of others dealing with challenges.

- Regular mental workouts can contribute to increased feelings of calm, happiness and longevity by keeping the brain active and engaged.

 Here is a summary of the key points about Joni's transformation:

- Joni struggled with anxiety, depression and low self-esteem for many years before getting help. She believed her issues stemmed from a lack of willpower. 

- She had a brain scan that revealed biological factors like low prefrontal cortex activity contributing to her problems, not just spiritual or willpower issues. This was an epiphany for her.

- Therapy, supplements to balance her brain, and a small amount of medication helped immensely. She was then ready to focus on her physical health. 

- Attending classes at Dr. Amen's clinic taught Joni about the link between nutrition and mood. She overhauled her diet and lifestyle with exercise. 

- Losing 10 pounds made a visible difference in Joni's appearance, but she attributes inner changes like happiness and balance as more important factors in looking younger. 

- Joni now prioritizes her brain and body health through consistent diet, supplements, exercise and self-care. She serves as an inspiration for holistic transformation.

 

- Joni has made positive lifestyle changes to improve her physical and mental health, including following a brain-healthy diet, regular exercise like hiking and biking, managing her ADD symptoms, and becoming debt-free by cutting up her credit cards. 

- She eats protein for breakfast, and focuses on whole foods like soup/salad or a healthy sandwich for lunch and fish/veggies/salad for dinner. 

- Her biggest challenge is late-night snacking when tempted by feelings of anxiety or past emotional trauma. She has learned healthy ways to cope instead of using food.

- Joni feels deeply supported by her community which has helped her stick to brain-healthy decisions. Her appearance now reflects her improved health and balanced brain. 

- Taking care of the health of your brain also improves the health and appearance of your skin, as the brain and skin are strongly connected. Nourishing your skin from the inside out with a healthy lifestyle prevents premature aging.

- Extreme plastic surgery is unnecessary when positive lifestyle changes can naturally lift, tighten and smooth your skin, while also benefiting your brain, heart and overall wellness. Joni's story emphasizes making changes from within.

 

- Drink plenty of water to hydrate the skin from inside out. Green or white tea can also be beneficial. 

- Omega-3, GLA from borage/evening primrose oil, and acetylcholine-rich foods help improve skin elasticity and moisture. 

- Polyphenols in tea have anti-inflammatory benefits for skin. White tea may be particularly effective for its antioxidants and ability to protect collagen and elastin.

- A diet high in plants like avocados, nuts, fatty fish and low in sugar and bad oils mimics the Japanese diet linked to youthful skin. Key nutrients are vitamins C and D, zinc, amino acids lysine and phenylalanine. 

- Supplements like omega-3s, probiotics, grape seed extract, alpha lipoic acid can further nourish skin from within. 

- Balancing hormones through diet and lifestyle supports skin health. Avoid stressors like excess sugar.

- Moderate sun exposure of 20 minutes daily or vitamin D3 aids skin, but too much sun is damaging.

The overall message is that healthy, glowing skin starts from nourishment and balance within the body through optimal nutrition, hydration, hormone levels and sun protection.

 

- People with light hair and fair skin need to be especially careful of sun exposure as they have higher rates of skin cancer than those with darker skin tones. 

- While sunscreen provides protection from UV rays, some sunscreen ingredients may be harmful. Moderation is key - getting 20 minutes of sun a day without sunscreen while avoiding sunburn can maintain vitamin D levels. 

- Eating foods with carotenoids like tomatoes, peppers and carrots can give the skin a healthy golden glow, as carotenoids are absorbed in the skin and provide antioxidant benefits. 

- Good vascular health and blood flow is important for healthy skin. Deep breathing, avoiding anemia, and regular exercise can improve blood flow. 

- Treating conditions like sleep apnea that decrease oxygen levels is also important for the skin. 

- Stress can contribute to wrinkles, so relaxing activities like massage, hypnosis and good sleep can help alleviate stress and benefit the skin. 

- Avoiding toxins like smoking, alcohol and environmental toxins protects the skin from damage and premature aging.

 

- Smiling more can help de-age your face because it causes facial muscles to engage in a way that lifts and brightens features. People who are happier and more grateful tend to smile more. 

- Cooking with liquid instead of dry heat reduces formations of AGEs (Advanced Glycation End products) in the body that cause skin aging. Steaming and poaching are better than grilling or broiling.

- Limiting caffeine is important as it dehydrates the skin, making it look dry and wrinkled. 

- Consuming alcohol in excess can dehydrate the skin, increase wrinkles, and cause permanently dilated blood vessels in the face. It also depletes vitamin A and damages the liver's ability to remove toxins.

- Having a loving relationship and regular sex lives can make people look younger. Sex releases endorphins and hormones that strengthen skin, bones and muscles. Studies found people who had sex 3 times a week looked on average 10 years younger. 

- Overall, maintaining a positive, fun relationship and regular Sexual activity is linked to many anti-aging and long-term health benefits for both physical appearance and longevity.

 Here is a summary of the key points from the passage:

- Sammie had inexplicable anxiety issues starting in 4th grade when her mom Chris took a new job. Her anxiety intensified to the point of constant illness fears. 

- During a fall while rollerblading, they discovered Sammie had osteosarcoma bone cancer that had spread to her lungs. She endured a tough year of chemotherapy and surgeries.

- After being cancer free briefly, the cancer returned and metastasized throughout her body, bringing endless medical interventions and agonizing pain for Sammie and her family. 

- Despite further chemotherapy attempts to slow the spread, Sammie's body couldn't take it and she went into cardiac arrest. Though revived by CPR, no more treatment was possible. 

- Chris and her husband had to shift to preparing their daughter to die peacefully, the hardest task imaginable for any parent. 

So in summary, the passage tells the heartbreaking true story of a little girl named Sammie who battled cancer for years with immense bravery and suffering, until her young life was tragically taken by the disease.

 

- Sammie, Chris' daughter, passed away after a years-long battle with illness that left Chris physically and emotionally depleted. 

- Following Sammie's death, Chris sank into a deep depression and began drinking heavily to cope with her grief. She considered taking her own life on the anniversary of Sammie's death.

- Chris was introduced to the book "Change Your Brain, Change Your Body" by a friend. She read the entire book in one night and decided to fully commit to the program. 

- Adopting a whole-food, nutrient-dense diet and starting to exercise helped Chris manage her anxiety and depression tremendously. Within a few months, her emotional state improved dramatically.

- Chris lost 35 pounds and feels healthier and happier than she has in years. Her relationships with her family have improved. 

- She has become an advocate for the program and lifestyle changes outlined in Dr. Amen's book. Her positive transformation has inspired others struggling with their own mental health issues.

- Meeting Dr. Amen in person was an emotional experience for Chris, as his work had such a profound impact on turning her life around after immense grief and trauma.

 

- Chris lost her daughter Sammie to childhood cancer. This led to deep depression, grief and stress for Chris. 

- To cope and heal, Chris made major life changes - she moved homes to escape sad memories, got a new job she enjoyed at a running shoe store, and focused on improving her health through diet, exercise and self-care.

- These positive steps helped Chris honor her daughter's memory in a better way and create a life she desired. She was able to overcome her issues and help others through her work.

- The story illustrates how negative emotions like depression, grief and chronic stress can overwhelm someone, but making active choices to improve mental and physical health can aid in healing from trauma over time.

 

- Grief is a normal response to loss that causes distress, but for some people (10-15% of those grieving), grief becomes "complicated" where the distress is unrelenting and never allows for healing and moving on. 

- Complicated grief can perpetuate the grief process longer and be debilitating with intense yearning and preoccupation with the deceased. It activates reward centers in the brain, possibly giving memories an addiction-like property. 

- Knowing your "brain type" is important for treatment. There are eight main types including impulsive, compulsive, anxious, etc. Each type responds differently to treatment. 

- The impulsive brain type has low activity in the prefrontal cortex, making impulse control difficult. Boosting dopamine can help strengthen the PFC. The compulsive type has too much activity in the anterior cingulate gyrus, getting stuck on negative thoughts. 

Understanding different brain types is key to targeting treatment for conditions like grief, depression, anxiety, etc. and moving past complicated or unrelenting grief towards healing.

 Here is a summary of the key points about the different brain types:

1. Rigid brain - Too much activity in the anterior cingulate cortex, making a person rigid and inflexible. Benefits from increasing serotonin through exercise, supplements like 5-HTP or St. John's Wort. 

2. Compulsive brain - Similar to rigid brain but also struggles with compulsions. Needs treatments to increase both serotonin and dopamine.

3. Impulsive-compulsive brain - Too much activity in anterior cingulate and not enough in prefrontal cortex, leading to getting stuck on thoughts and poor behavioral control. Benefits from treatments increasing both serotonin and dopamine. 

4. Sad/moody brain - Too much activity in the limbic system, making one prone to depression. Helped by exercise, fish oil, SAMe. Connections between depression and physical pain.

5. Anxious brain - Too much activity in the basal ganglia, leading to feeling tense, panicky and stressed. Calmed by meditation, supplements like B6, magnesium and GABA.

6. Temporal lobe brain - Issues in the temporal lobes from prior injury can impact mood, memory and behavior. Helped by antiseizure meds and lifestyle changes. 

7. Toxic brain - Overall low brain activity due to various toxic exposures, infections, injuries. Priority is eliminating the toxin/cause before treatment. 

8. Post-traumatic stress brain - "Diamond plus" pattern in scans from emotional trauma, especially if the brain was vulnerable during the trauma(s).

 

- The passage describes how brain SPECT scans can identify a "diamond-plus pattern" associated with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This pattern shows increased activity in key areas of the brain.

- The areas of increased activity include the anterior cingulate gyrus (associated with negative thoughts), deep limbic system (feelings of sadness), and outside of the right temporal lobe (where traumatic memories may be stored). 

- This pattern suggests trauma gets "stuck" in the brain. A case study is described of a man (Frank) who showed this pattern on his scan due to unresolved childhood trauma. 

- Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) therapy is recommended to help resolve traumatic memories seen on brain scans and reduce the diamond-plus activity pattern. 

- The ANT (automatic negative thoughts) technique is presented as a way to help identify and dispute negative thinking patterns that can result from unresolved trauma and contribute to issues like depression. 

- Byron Katie's "The Work" is outlined as another method focusing on questioning thoughts to determine their accuracy and impact, and turning thoughts around to alternative perspectives.

 Here are the key points from the passage:

- Anthony Davis, known as "AD", is a former college football running back from USC. He had great success against Notre Dame in the 1970s, scoring 10 touchdowns against them total. 

- At age 54, AD came to the Amen Clinics concerned about cognitive issues he saw in other retired NFL players. Scans of his brain looked like that of an 85-year-old, showing trauma to the prefrontal cortex and left temporal lobe. 

- The Amen Clinics have done work in brain rehabilitation for 20 years, demonstrating the brain's ability to improve after trauma and damage. This suggests AD believed the Amen Clinics could help improve his cognitive functioning and reverse some of the effects of the brain damage from his football career.

- Football players are at risk of cognitive issues later in life due to repeated head injuries/concussions sustained during their playing careers. AD served as an example patient seeking help from the Amen Clinics to address issues potentially resulting from his time playing football.

So in summary, the passage discusses a former star college running back, AD, who came to the Amen Clinics at age 54 for scans that showed substantial football-related brain damage, having faith the Clinics' brain rehabilitation work could help improve his cognition.

 

Dr. Amen conducted a study on 115 current and former NFL players to examine the effects of brain injuries from playing football. Almost all players showed evidence of brain damage on SPECT scans. However, the study found that recovery and improvement in brain function is possible even decades after the initial brain injuries occurred. 

70% of players who went through Dr. Amen's brain rehabilitation program showed significant improvement on follow-up SPECT scans and neuropsychological testing. The key components of the program included education, nutrition counseling, exercise, natural supplements like fish oil and Brain and Memory Power Boost formula, and in some cases hyperbaric oxygen therapy or medications. 

Case studies of four players - Roy Williams, Marvin Fleming, Fred Dryer, and an unnamed player - showed how their brains and cognitive function substantially improved after following Dr. Amen's program. This provided evidence that even severely damaged brains can recover and regain activity and function through the right rehabilitation approach.

 

- Cam Cleeland is a 34-year-old former NFL player who retired due to struggles with depression, irritability, memory problems, and marital issues stemming from 8 concussions over his career. 

- Brain scans and cognitive testing showed significant brain damage, decreases in functioning. After 8 months on a brain rehabilitation program, Cam noticed dramatic improvements in his symptoms and functioning. Follow up scans showed improvement in damaged brain areas.

- Captain Patrick Caffrey suffered 3 blast injuries while serving in Afghanistan, on top of previous concussions. After returning home his personality changed, with increased anger and cognitive issues. Brain scans showed damage. Supplements and lifestyle changes helped improve his symptoms.

- The author notes that if brain rehabilitation programs can help retired NFL players, they can benefit anyone suffering brain issues from various causes like substance abuse or trauma. A personal brain health program including supplements, lifestyle changes, and potential treatments like HBOT or neurofeedback can help slow aging and potentially reverse some damage. 

- Ray White played in the NFL and his wife Nancy was diagnosed with frontal temporal dementia. Both showed brain issues on scans. Adhering to a brain health program showed potential benefits for Nancy's condition against expectations.

 

- Dr. Amen tells the story of two friends, Rick Cortez and Marco, to illustrate how having a "genius network" of supportive friends can help people improve their health. 

- Rick was originally over 350 pounds and relied heavily on fast food. He had tried losing weight unsuccessfully before. 

- After working on one of Dr. Amen's public television specials, Marco approached Rick about trying Dr. Amen's health solutions together. 

- Marco showed Rick before/after photos of a friend who lost 150 pounds through lifestyle changes. This inspired Rick to commit to losing weight.

- Rick and Marco checked in daily for support and accountability. Rick credits Marco for making the difference and keeping him motivated. 

- In the time since, Rick has lost 97 pounds through healthy eating and lifestyle changes with Marco's support. He feels much younger and more confident. 

- The story shows how having friends committed to the same health goals can help drive success, as Rick was able to lose weight long-term with Marco's encouragement in his "genius network."

 

- Rick gained weight over time due to unhealthy eating habits in college and his career, which required long hours at a desk. He would frequently eat fast food and sit down to watch movies while eating ice cream. 

- He made some attempts to lose weight, like hiring a trainer, but found the efforts too difficult to sustain. He settled into being unhappily overweight. 

- Rick was inspired to lose weight after his friend Marco, who had lost 150 pounds, reached out to encourage him. They provided mutual support for each other.

- Having social support is key to success, as positive relationships strengthen health. Studies show lack of social connections increases health risks and early death. Being part of a community helps relieve stress. 

- The kind of company you keep also matters - unhealthy habits can spread among social groups. If your friends improve their health, it tends to help improve your own health as well. 

- Many institutions like schools, hospitals, and churches could do more to encourage better health, rather than inadvertently promoting unhealthy eating through food options. Changing these environments could make a big difference.

 

- Pastor Rick Warren of Saddleback Church invited Dr. Amen to help develop a health initiative for the church called the Daniel Plan, based on the biblical story of Daniel refusing the king's unhealthy food. 

- Dr. Amen was concerned about the unhealthy snacks like pastries and sodas served at the church. In an interview, Pastor Warren seemed resistant to changing these traditions.

- Over the next 3 months, Dr. Amen and others developed a 52-week small group program called the Daniel Plan to help the congregation get healthier through diet, exercise and lifestyle changes. Small groups are a key part of how Saddleback operates. 

- The plan launched in January with the goal of using Saddleback's existing small group structure to provide support, accountability and education to help people change behaviors and get healthier. Pastor Warren's goal was for the next 10 years to be the healthiest for himself and the church.

- Dr. Amen was hopeful the Daniel Plan could help Pastor Warren, who was over 300 pounds, and change the church's traditions around unhealthy foods that were contributing to obesity in the congregation. But Pastor Warren was resistant to some proposed changes at first.

 

- The pastor told his congregation that between now and January 1st, they could eat whatever they wanted. This baffled the author, as he believes real change needs to start immediately, not be put off till the future. 

- The author discussed this with the pastor, Rick. Rick realized his message was like telling someone to have last flings before marriage, not conducive to real change. Change needs to start now. 

- For Christmas, the author gave Rick a book by C.S. Lewis with the message that change happens in the present moment, not gradually over time. You need a sense of urgency to change.

- In January 2011, over 9,000 people signed up for the Daniel Plan launched at Saddleback Church to get healthy. By October, Rick had lost 50 pounds following the plan. 

- Key things Rick did were keeping a food journal, drinking water, getting enough sleep, eating high quality foods by eliminating things like sugar and flour, getting exercise, taking supplements, and being accountable in a small group. 

- Many people reported significant health improvements and weight loss following the Daniel Plan principles as part of a small group, which provided crucial social support for change. Forming communities helped people sustain lifestyle changes long term.

 

- Friends and families use small supportive groups to encourage each other to get healthier through lifestyle changes like walking, exercise classes, and cooking healthy meals together. 

- Being in a caring community provides emotional support that helps motivate physical changes. One woman lost 40 pounds and improved her mental health by joining a group. 

- Leaders share their own health struggles to create an honest and vulnerable environment. Pastor Rick admitted he gained weight and needed to improve.

- Groups influence social eating habits by choosing healthy restaurants and sharing nutritious recipes at meetings. 

- Close proximity, accountability, encouragement, and limited commitment periods (6 weeks initially) help groups succeed. Members motivate each other to follow through.

- Spouses can have important conversations about prioritizing family health and leaving a good legacy for children. This inspired Pastor Steve to lose 35 pounds and improve his medical issues through diet and lifestyle changes with his wife's support.

 

- Steve underwent brain SPECT scans before and after starting a health program. His follow-up scan showed remarkable improvement in his prefrontal cortex and his attention scores had dramatically improved after just five months. 

- Loving relationships can help people live longer by monitoring each other's health. Saddleback Church saw health improvements after implementing a program where many participated together.

- Creating a "genius network" of supporters who can help hold each other accountable to health goals is an effective strategy, as social relationships strongly influence health behaviors and outcomes. 

- Some keys to success include exercising together, cooking healthy meals as a social activity, focusing on health every day, prioritizing sleep, choosing supportive friends, and celebrating wins as a group. Creating an online community can also provide virtual support. Doing health activities together makes it more fun and sustainable long-term.

 

The author describes how getting his own brain scanned in 1991 made him develop "brain envy" when he saw its toxic and bumpy appearance, despite having a relatively clean lifestyle. He realized his brain was not as healthy as it could be due to past habits like playing football, eating poor quality food, lack of sleep, stress, and soda consumption. 

After improving his lifestyle based on brain imaging principles, his follow-up scans 15 years later showed marked improvement in brain health. This personal experience motivated him to apply brain imaging to his psychiatric practice to better understand and treat patients. He provides examples of how brain SPECT imaging helped correctly diagnose and treat patients, guiding treatment when other approaches had failed or caused harm. The imaging helped validate diagnoses, detect underlying issues not found through other means, and convince skeptical patients to get proper treatment. It significantly improved his ability to help people by lifting the "darkness" of not fully understanding the brain's role in psychiatric conditions.

 

- SPECT imaging significantly changed the psychiatrist's practice by allowing him to visualize abnormalities in patients' brains that informed more accurate diagnoses and targeted treatment plans. It helped avoid misdiagnoses and uncovered issues like infections, injuries, and toxic exposures.

- Case examples showed how SPECT revealed abnormalities that explained treatment-resistant conditions and changed patient management. It increased treatment effectiveness and patient compliance by addressing underlying brain issues. 

- SPECT decreased stigma around mental health by illustrating problems in medical rather than moral terms. It directed use of more natural treatments and cautious medication management.

- Not seeing patients' brain function could result in missed diagnoses and ineffective treatments. SPECT served as a valuable tool especially for unclear or treatment-resistant cases, similar to how radar helps pilots in stormy conditions.

- If SPECT is not available, questionnaires can help predict scan findings and suggest lifestyle and treatment approaches, though scanning provides more accurate information. Insurance coverage of SPECT should be expanded based on medical necessity in some cases.

- Maintaining brain health requires lifestyle habits like those promoted to patients, to act as a "brain warrior" for oneself and loved ones.

 

- The passage encourages the reader to be a "brain warrior" and take control of their own brain health, as others will not do it for them. 

- It lists various actions one can take to boost brain health, such as eating a healthy diet, getting exercise, managing stress, avoiding toxins, monitoring mental health, reducing negative thought patterns, socializing with healthy people, and taking simple supplements. 

- Taking care of brain health can help reduce the effects of aging on the brain and even reduce a person's "functional age." Small changes over time can have big impacts. 

- Brain scans can help motivate changes by revealing issues to those in denial. One's brain health impacts decision-making and life quality. 

- The appendix discusses natural supplements that may enhance brain function and extend life when used alongside other healthy lifestyle changes. While supplements have pros like fewer side effects, there are also cons like a lack of regulation. Thorough research is recommended before taking anything.

In summary, the passage encourages proactively managing one's own brain health through various healthy lifestyle practices and potentially supplements, as this can significantly improve cognitive function and quality of life. Being aware of brain health issues is the first step to making positive changes.

 

The supplement line developed by Amen Clinics, called Amen Solution supplements, aims to provide high-quality, research-based supplements for patients. Three supplements are universally recommended:

1. Multivitamin - Most Americans are deficient in vitamins and minerals due to poor diets. A multivitamin can fill nutritional gaps. Studies show multivitamins improve mood, mental performance and DNA health. NeuroVite Plus is the brand recommended. 

2. Fish oil - Low omega-3 fatty acid levels are linked to many health issues like heart disease, depression and dementia. Fish oil contains EPA and DHA crucial for brain and health. Studies show fish oil improves mood, cognition and can aid weight loss when combined with exercise. 

3. Vitamin D - Vitamin D deficiency is widespread and plays a role in brain health. Ensuring optimal vitamin D is important for overall wellness. The supplements aim to support healthy brain function, mood and body through targeted nutrients. Consulting a healthcare provider is advised when taking supplements.

 

- Studies have found that higher levels of DHA are linked to better performance on cognitive tests in middle-aged people. Teen boys who ate fish more than once a week scored higher on IQ tests. 

- Omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil may increase attention in ADHD, reduce stress, and lower psychosis risk. Retired football players taking fish oil were able to decrease or eliminate pain medications. 

- The recommended daily dosage of high-quality fish oil is 1-2g, balanced between EPA and DHA. Omega-3 Power is a purified fish oil supplement meeting high purity standards. 

- Vitamin D is important for brain health, mood, memory, weight management. Low levels are linked to depression, obesity, Alzheimer's, and more. Supplementation may aid in weight loss and cognitive function. 

- Several brain health supplements are discussed - Brain and Memory Power Boost, Craving Control for managing cravings, Restful Sleep for sleep support, SAMe for mood and joints, and Serotonin Mood Support. Each contains specific ingredients to target related functions.

In summary, the passage discusses the cognitive and health benefits of omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin D, provides dosage recommendations, and introduces several brain health supplement formulas targeting areas like memory, cravings, sleep, mood and joints.

 Here is a summary of the key points from the passages:

- Serotonin Mood Support is useful for supporting a healthy mood, especially when serotonin levels are suspected to be low. It can help people who tend to get stuck on negative thoughts or behaviors. Studies have also shown it supports healthy sleep patterns. 

- Focus and Energy Optimizer is formulated without caffeine to avoid jitteriness. It uses green tea, choline, and three adaptogens (ashwagandha, rhodiola, and panax ginseng) to support focus, endurance, stamina, and a healthy immune system. Adaptogens have been shown to improve the body's resistance to stress.

- GABA Calming Support promotes relaxation and calm by providing inhibitory neurotransmitters like GABA to quiet an overactive mind. It contains clinically tested PharmaGABA and vitamins/herbs like B6, magnesium, and lemon balm traditionally known for calming effects. 

- Robert was a former NFL player who participated in a brain trauma study. His initial scans and memory tests showed significant brain damage and poor memory. However, after faithfully taking brain supplements, his follow up scans and tests showed dramatic improvement in brain function and memory, scoring 1000% higher on tests. His brain had literally aged backward due to the simple supplements.

- The information in the book is based on over 400 scientific sources to support healthy aging. The author acknowledges many colleagues, medical professionals, and patients who contributed to the work.

- Head injuries, toxins, infections and other risk factors that can impact brain health are briefly covered.

So in summary, it discusses the brain from many angles including biochemistry, lifestyle, cognition and provides guidance for optimizing mental and physical wellness.

 Here is a summary of key points about natural disasters:

- Natural disasters are events caused by natural hazards such as earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires, etc. that have harmful effects on humans and the environment.

- Common natural disasters include floods, hurricanes/cyclones, tornadoes, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, wildfires, droughts, and landslides. 

- The effects of natural disasters can include loss of human life, damage to property and infrastructure, economic losses from business interruption, impacts on agriculture and food systems, and environmental damage.

- Factors like population growth, increasing urbanization, deforestation, and climate change are exacerbating the impacts of some natural disasters by making more people and infrastructure vulnerable.

- Developing countries tend to be more vulnerable to natural disasters due to factors like poorer quality housing and infrastructure, limited disaster management resources, and greater dependence on agriculture and natural resource-based livelihoods.

- Prevention and mitigation efforts like zoning regulations, building codes, early warning systems, and disaster preparedness plans can help reduce risks from natural disasters. Relief and recovery aid is also needed after major disasters.

- Natural disasters are becoming more frequent and intense in many parts of the world due to climate change increases the likelihood of hazards such as droughts, wildfires, intense rainfall events and hurricanes.
