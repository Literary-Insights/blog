The speaker says they cannot see the comments live but wants people to post comments so they can see them later. They say they are grateful for people's time and will try their best to teach clearly and transparently. 

The speaker says their intention is not to deceive, otherwise they would not show their face or offer good products for low prices. They appreciate people's time and want to have an engaging discussion. 

The plan is to teach how to build products professionally, looking at important questions and strategies. The live session will connect to the previous one. The goal is to share knowledge and understand each other better. 

The speaker will analyze interesting businesses that are sent to them, pointing out what they do right and wrong. No one else is doing live sessions like this. They want to openly share their own businesses and how they help people. 

There are two types of content the speaker likes - about principles and examples of how people actually do things. Words have limitations so it's better to see examples. They will focus on examples after covering important foundational principles. 

The session topic of creating products professionally versus amateurishly is important to save time and avoid mistakes. It will help filter out bad ideas. Time is the most precious asset so the goal is to provide resources to use time freely and prosper.

- The speaker emphasizes that developing a strong mental model of modeling (ideation) is one of the most important things to focus on. This model will allow you to generate good ideas with high financial potential. 

- In the beginning, it's difficult to come up with good ideas. The Machine of Ideas program aims to act as a filter to help generate and select good seed ideas, rather than wasting time on poor ideas that won't grow. 

- A good idea is defined as one with high financial potential, something that could generate R$5,000 to R$100,000 in revenue within 12 months if implemented carefully. 

- The speaker wants to help listeners believe they can create ideas that work, rather than believing their ideas are already good. Their goal is to give listeners the skills and filters to systematically produce ideas with potential. 

- Other topics mentioned briefly include mental models of leverage, asymmetry and digital HD2 marketing. But the focus is on first developing a strong modeling mental model to unlock idea generation abilities and get out of the "poverty zone" of ideas.

So in summary, the speaker stresses the importance of ideation skills and provides a framework for systematically generating high-potential ideas that can be financially successful. Their program aims to teach listeners how to think in a way that produces more viable seed ideas.

 Here is a summary of the key points:

- The speaker is introducing a formula they use to conceptually design products with millionaire potential. 

- They say people won't believe the formula, but it's what they actually think about and focus on when designing products. 

- The speaker emphasizes some parts they will say to note or write down, as these will be the "key turns" or things that help recall everything when re-reading later. 

- They want to teach people to fish rather than give them a fish, so people don't depend on them. Their goal is to impart knowledge, not have people rely on them for opportunities. 

- The session will be intimate as the speaker shares deep personal ideas about how they see building high-impact products and companies that can positively change thousands of lives. 

- They will reveal the "tip of the arrow" of the formula, which is focused on four key items or aspects. The cost of the product is not included as that is not what they think about in their conceptual design process.

So in summary, the speaker is introducing a personal formula for conceptualizing million-dollar product ideas, and will reveal the first four aspects of that formula for the group to learn and apply independently.
