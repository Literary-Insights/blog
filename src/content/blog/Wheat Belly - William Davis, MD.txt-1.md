 Here is a summary:

- The introduction discusses how people were generally much thinner in the 1950s-1960s compared to today, even though they exercised less. It questions what has changed and argues that modern wheat is the main culprit behind increasing obesity rates. 

- The book will make the case that modern wheat, which has been genetically modified, is functionally not the same food as traditional wheat and has various adverse health effects. Removing wheat can lead to rapid and significant weight loss and improved health. 

- The contents section provides an overview of the book's major parts: the first discusses how wheat has been modified and deconstructed; the second examines wheat's effects on various body systems and diseases; the third provides advice on living wheat-free.

- The introduction concludes by saying it's not the reader's fault if wheat has negatively impacted their health, and that eliminating wheat can eliminate weight and health problems gained from consuming it. The book seeks to show that widely accepted advice to eat whole grains like wheat has actually been detrimental to health.

 Here is a summary:

- A wheat belly refers to the accumulation of abdominal/visceral fat that results from years of consuming wheat and other foods that trigger insulin and fat storage. Visceral fat is problematic as it provokes inflammation and metabolic issues.

- Beyond external fat accumulation, wheat can negatively impact virtually every organ in the body from the intestines to the liver, heart, thyroid, and even brain. 

- The proliferation of wheat products in the American diet parallels the expansion of waistlines. Advice to cut fat and eat more whole grains coincided with a sharp rise in obesity starting in 1985. 

- Of all dietary gluten sources, wheat overwhelmingly dominates American diets. The author focuses on wheat because gluten exposure can be used interchangeably with wheat exposure for most people. 

- Through both his personal experiences and observations as a cardiologist, the author believes wheat is making people fatter and contributing to health problems in unexpected ways from "mouth to anus, brain to pancreas."

 Here is a summary:

- The passage discusses how wheat consumption, particularly wheat belly or belly fat, has risen profoundly in Americans due to modern wheat being vastly different from ancestral wheat. 

- The author provided patients with a handout replacing wheat-based foods with low-glycemic whole foods. After 3 months, blood sugar levels dropped significantly for many patients, even "curing" some cases of diabetes. Patients also saw improved symptoms for acid reflux, IBS, energy levels, sleep, skin rashes, arthritis pain, asthma, and athletic performance. 

- "Wheat challenges" where patients at small amounts of wheat saw immediate symptoms return convinced the author further that wheat was the culprit. What started as a simple blood sugar experiment revealed wheat's impact on multiple health conditions and weight loss. 

- The radical removal of wheat from the diet is likened to withdrawing from addictive substances. While psychologically difficult, it allows patients to recover their health. The passage discusses how ubiquitous and ingrained wheat has become in the American diet and why removing it provides significant health benefits beyond just blood sugar control.

 Here is a summary:

- Wheat has changed significantly over time from human interventions like selective breeding, more so than natural evolution. 

- Early humans like the Natufians in the Fertile Crescent first harvested and cultivated wild einkorn wheat around 8500 BC. This marked the beginning of agriculture. 

- Over thousands of years, emmer wheat and then Triticum aestivum wheat species emerged through natural hybridization with other grasses. T. aestivum became the dominant species cultivated by humans.

- Wheat changed little for centuries. But in the late 20th century, new hybridization methods transformed wheat genetically, driven by goals like increased yields rather than human health compatibility. 

- As a result, modern wheat is very different from historic varieties and may contribute to immune responses in some people, though it looks and tastes similar. Early wheat archetypes like einkorn provided sustenance but yielded poor quality for baking versus modern wheat.

So in summary, the passage traces the genetic evolution and domestication of wheat over millennia, emphasizing how modern wheat differs substantially from ancient varieties due to recent human manipulations.

 Here is a summary:

- Wheat was first domesticated over 10,000 years ago in the Middle East from wild grasses and was originally hand harvested. 

- Wheat made its way to the New World through European explorers and colonists in the 15th-16th centuries, first being planted in Puerto Rico, Mexico, and then the eastern US. 

- Over centuries, wheat evolved and was modified through selective breeding to increase yields. In the 20th century, coordinated efforts like at IMWIC in Mexico led to the development of high-yielding dwarf and semi-dwarf wheat varieties through hybridization. 

- Norman Borlaug's development of short, sturdy dwarf wheat varieties in the 1960s was particularly influential, resisting lodging/buckling and allowing higher fertilizer use and two harvests per year. This "Green Revolution" wheat greatly increased global wheat supplies. 

- However, no safety testing was conducted on the new genetically modified wheat varieties before widespread adoption and human consumption, despite significant genetic changes from hybridization. It was simply assumed new varieties would be safe since they remained "wheat."

 Here is a summary:

- Wheat has undergone extensive hybridization over the past 50-10,000 years of agriculture to increase yields. This hybridization has resulted in genetic changes and variations that were not intentionally selected for. 

- Analysis has shown that 5% of proteins expressed in wheat hybrids are unique and not present in either parent strain. New gluten proteins have been identified in hybrids. 

- Modern wheat expresses more gluten proteins associated with celiac disease compared to older wheat strains from centuries ago. 

- The thousands of new wheat hybrids developed through hybridization entered the human food supply without any safety testing, unlike genetically modified crops today which require testing. 

- Unexpected genetic changes from hybridization could potentially impact human health, but the specific hybrids introducing undesirable effects cannot be identified since no documentation of testing was conducted. 

- The author conducted a personal experiment comparing their reaction to einkorn wheat vs modern wheat and found much less severe symptoms after eating einkorn. This raises questions about differences between ancient and modern hybridized wheat.

 Here is a summary:

- Wheat flour is mostly carbohydrates (70%), with protein and fiber each making up 10-15%. The carbs are complex carbohydrates called amylopectin and amylose. 

- Amylopectin exists in different forms depending on its source. Wheat contains amylopectin A, the most digestible form. It is rapidly converted to glucose and raises blood sugar levels more than other carb sources like beans or potatoes. 

- Whole wheat bread and other wheat products raise blood sugar higher than table sugar. Studies show whole grain bread has a higher glycemic index than foods like Mars bars or Snickers. 

- Pasta has a lower glycemic index than other wheat products, but can still raise blood sugar levels for 4-6 hours after eating. 

- The rapid rise and fall in blood sugar from wheat causes cravings and roller coaster energy levels. Repeatedly high blood sugar also leads to more fat storage through insulin. This helps explain weight gain trends from heavy wheat consumption.

 Here is a summary:

- Wheat contains gluten proteins (gliadins and glutenins) which give dough its stretchy texture and allow bread to rise. Gluten varies between different wheat strains. 

- Modern wheat (Triticum aestivum) contains 3 genomes (A, B, D) which code for the most variety of gluten proteins compared to older wheat strains. The D genome in particular has undergone genetic modifications that have changed gluten characteristics.

- In addition to gluten, wheat contains over 1,000 other proteins that perform various functions. It is not just a simple carbohydrate. 

- Certain wheat proteins besides gluten can trigger allergic or autoimmune reactions in susceptible individuals, like celiac disease from alpha-gliadin ingestion or wheat-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis from various glutenins and gliadins. 

- Due to its complex protein and enzyme composition that varies by genetic code, wheat can have wide-ranging physiological effects beyond just provoking immune reactions in certain people. The next sections will explore wheat's potential head-to-toe health impacts.

 Here is a summary:

- Wheat can have powerful psychological and physiological effects on some people, similar to addictive drugs like opiates or crack cocaine. It can induce cravings, obsessive thoughts, and withdrawal symptoms when removed from the diet. 

- Studies on schizophrenic patients found that removing wheat from their diets significantly improved symptoms like hallucinations and delusions. Adding it back caused symptoms to return. This suggests wheat worsens the condition. 

- Small studies also found improvements in autism and ADHD behaviors when wheat/gluten was removed, though responses are complex due to other dietary sensitivities. 

- The effects are likely due to "exorphins" - opioid peptides produced when wheat gluten is digested that can attach to opioid receptors in the brain. This helps explain both addictive and schizophrenia-worsening properties of wheat.

So in summary, wheat can powerfully impact brain chemistry and mental state for some individuals, especially those with conditions like schizophrenia, through its exorphins interacting with the brain's opioid system. This helps explain its reported addictive and symptom-worsening effects.

 Here is a summary:

- Gluten polypeptides exposed to stomach enzymes were found to penetrate the blood-brain barrier and bind to the brain's morphine receptors. This ability was similar to endogenous morphine-like compounds in the brain.

- These wheat-derived polypeptides were dubbed "exorphins" and the dominant one was named "gluteomorphin". It was speculated they may contribute to symptoms in schizophrenia patients. 

- Administration of the opiate-blocking drug naloxone blocked the effects of wheat exorphins in both animal and human studies. This suggests wheat exorphins act on the brain like opiates.

- Studies gave naloxone to schizophrenic patients and found it reduced hallucinations, suggesting wheat exorphins may influence schizophrenia symptoms. However, further studies comparing wheat diets with and without naloxone were not conducted.

- Naloxone reduced calorie intake from wheat products in normal humans, indicating wheat exorphins stimulate appetite and cravings via the brain's reward system. Withdrawal effects are also possible from removing wheat.

- In summary, wheat digestion produces opiate-like compounds that can influence brain function and behavior, especially with regards to appetite, cravings and potentially mental health issues like schizophrenia. This makes wheat uniquely neuroactive compared to other foods.

 Here is a summary:

- The author argues that wheat can act as a drug in the brain, causing neurological effects similar to opioids like euphoria and appetite stimulation. 

- Removing wheat from the diet can lead to withdrawal symptoms like irritability, but also reduces cravings, calorie intake, weight, and improves mood and well-being. 

- The accumulation of abdominal fat from wheat is specifically around the belly and not other parts of the body. This "wheat belly" contributes to the obesity crisis.

- Agricultural changes have made modern wheat more likely to cause weight gain. Government recommendations to eat more whole grains, coupled with food industry profit motives, have exacerbated the obesity epidemic.

- Case studies are presented showing significant weight loss and waistline reduction from individuals eliminating wheat from their diets long-term. The author argues wheat is a key driver of obesity more so than inactivity or sugary foods alone.

 Here is a summary:

- Sucrose and food coloring are now major ingredients in many processed foods sold in supermarkets, which tend to fill interior aisles while whole foods like produce are on the perimeter. 

- Big Food companies like Kraft have seen huge revenue growth selling highly processed wheat- and corn-based snacks. Kraft's revenue increased 1,800% since the late 1980s, largely from these snacks.

- Wheat triggers cycles of high blood sugar and insulin that drive hunger and fat deposition. This leads specifically to visceral fat accumulation around the organs. Repeated over time, this results in a "wheat belly."

- Visceral fat is metabolically active and inflammatory, unlike subcutaneous fat in the limbs. It produces hormones like leptin that raise disease risk. A large wheat belly substantially increases health risks.

- Reducing or eliminating wheat is predicted to significantly lower risks of diseases tied to visceral fat and inflammation like breast cancer, but this effect has not been directly studied.

 Here is a summary:

- "Man boobs," "man cans," or gynecomastia refers to enlarged male breasts. It can be caused by increased levels of estrogen and the hormone prolactin. 

- Visceral fat increases prolactin levels up to sevenfold. Prolactin stimulates breast tissue growth and milk production. 

- Having enlarged breasts as a male is evidence of increased estrogen and prolactin levels caused by visceral fat around the waist. 

- Male breast reduction surgery is becoming more common as more men are embarrassed by enlarged breasts. Other solutions include special clothing, compression vests, exercise programs. 

- Increased estrogen, breast cancer, and gynecomastia can all potentially result from excess visceral fat gained from eating shared snacks like bagels in the office.

So in summary, excess visceral fat from poor diet and lifestyle can disrupt hormone levels and potentially lead to enlarged male breasts, increased cancer risk, and other health issues.

 Here are the key points about celiac disease and wheat from the summary:

- Celiac disease is an autoimmune condition where the ingestion of gluten leads to damage and inflammation of the small intestine. 

- It is triggered by the protein gluten, which is found primarily in wheat, barley, rye and potentially oats. People with celiac must avoid all foods containing gluten. 

- Celiac is caused by a failure of the human body to properly adapt to wheat, which was only introduced into the human diet around 10,000 years ago, not enough time for full genetic adaptation. 

- While the passages focus mainly on celiac, the author argues that wheat can also negatively impact health in non-celiac individuals through intolerance or sensitivity. Understanding celiac provides insights into how wheat affects the body.

- The prevalence of celiac disease has increased four-fold in the last 50 years, possibly due to changes in wheat cultivation and composition over time. Avoiding wheat and gluten is key to managing celiac disease.

So in summary, celiac disease is an autoimmune reaction to wheat gluten that damages the small intestine, and understanding it helps explain how wheat can negatively impact both celiac and non-celiac individuals.

 Here is a summary:

- Celiac disease causes severe diarrhea, cramping, malnutrition and can be life-threatening if left untreated. Early treatments like castor oil, frequent enemas, or only eating toasted bread were largely ineffective. 

- In the 1880s, Dr. Samuel Gee had some success treating celiac patients with a diet consisting only of mussels. In the early 20th century, Dr. Sidney Haas had patients follow an eight bananas per day diet which also provided some relief.

- The connection between celiac disease and wheat consumption was first made in 1953 by Dutch pediatrician Dr. Willem-Karel Dicke. He observed improvements in symptoms when bread became scarce during WWII, and deterioration when bread was air-dropped in. His studies confirmed gluten from wheat, barley and rye was the cause.

- Gluten elimination through a strict gluten-free diet provided dramatic cures and improvements over previous regimens like the banana or mussel diets. This definitively linked celiac disease to gluten consumption.

 Here is a summary:

- The endomysium antibody test identifies an intestinal tissue protein called endomysium that triggers an antibody response in celiac disease. Introduced in the mid-1990s, it is the most accurate antibody test, identifying over 90% of celiac cases. 

- HLA DQ2 and DQ8 are genetic markers that predispose people to celiac disease. Over 90% of diagnosed celiac disease patients have one or both markers. 

- Around 40% of the population have celiac-related genetic or antibody markers but no symptoms. Eliminating gluten has still been shown to provide health benefits for this group.

- A small intestine biopsy remains the gold standard diagnostic test, but some experts argue antibody tests are now reliable enough that biopsy may be unnecessary. 

- Wheat gliadin allows intestinal permeability via zonulin release. This allows unwanted proteins like gliadin to enter the bloodstream and trigger immune responses.

- Celiac disease is associated with many non-intestinal conditions like diabetes and neurological disorders. It may be more accurate to consider it an immune-mediated gluten intolerance rather than limiting it to intestinal symptoms. Lack of intestinal symptoms can make correct diagnosis more difficult.

 Here is a summary:

- Conditions associated with celiac disease and immune-mediated gluten intolerance include dermatitis herpetiformis (itchy rash), liver diseases, and autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, thyroid issues, and inflammatory bowel diseases. 

- Insulin-dependent diabetes has a higher association with celiac disease markers. Some evidence suggests gluten may play a role in certain cases of type 1 diabetes.

- Neurological conditions like ataxia (loss of muscle coordination) and peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage in limbs) show a surprisingly high incidence of celiac markers. There is even a condition called gluten encephalopathy involving brain impairment.

- Common nutritional deficiencies in celiac include anemia, and deficiencies in vitamins B12, folate, zinc, and fat-soluble vitamins. 

- In summary, reactions to gluten have been linked to effects on virtually every organ system. Celiac disease represents just a subset of a broader spectrum of immune-mediated gluten intolerance that can manifest in diverse ways.

 Here is a summary:

- A study of over 29,000 people with celiac disease found that those with "latent" (undiagnosed) celiac had a 30-49% increased risk of fatal cancers, cardiovascular disease, and respiratory diseases. Untreated celiac can lead to serious health issues. 

- Celiac disease increases the risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in the small intestine by up to 40 times. Following a gluten-free diet can reduce this risk to normal levels within 5 years. 

- Continued gluten consumption for those with celiac or gluten sensitivity significantly increases risks for certain cancers. Strict gluten avoidance is needed to reduce risks. 

- However, over 90% of those with celiac are undiagnosed, unknowingly putting themselves at risk. Wheat can silently cause cancer without the person realizing they have celiac. 

- Gluten avoidance is challenging as wheat is ubiquitous, even found in unexpected products like medications, cosmetics and communion wafers. Celiac sufferers must be vigilant.

- Conditions like IBS and acid reflux may represent milder forms of celiac. Eliminating wheat often provides relief of symptoms, whether or not celiac markers are present. 

- Celiac disease is a permanent, lifelong condition. However, following a gluten-free diet can free someone from symptoms and health risks while still allowing enjoyment of food.

 Here is a summary:

- Wheat is closely linked to diabetes. Diabetes was virtually unknown before the introduction of grains like wheat in the Neolithic era.

- Traditional diets without wheat did not cause diabetes or complications. But as grains were incorporated, diseases like diabetes began to emerge archaeologically. 

- Modern diabetes dates back to descriptions from ancient Egypt and India, where it was linked to sweet-tasting urine. 

- Insulin treatment in the 1920s saved children with Type 1 diabetes but obscured the distinction from Type 2, which is driven more by insulin resistance.

- In the 1980s, low-fat dietary advice led to replacing fat with "healthy" grains like wheat. This massive carb increase fueled the diabetes epidemic we see today. 

- Diabetes has skyrocketed since the mid-1980s. 1 in 3 US adults now have diabetes or prediabetes. It has become ubiquitous across all demographics.

- Removing wheat could break this linkage and reverse the phenomena driving insulin resistance and diabetes progression, improving health outcomes and costs significantly.

 Here is a summary of the key points:

- The rise in rates of diabetes and prediabetes parallels increases in overweight/obesity, as weight gain impairs insulin sensitivity and leads to excess visceral fat accumulation which causes diabetes. 

- Carbohydrate intake, especially from wheat products which spike blood sugar, initiates a process that damages pancreatic beta cells through glucotoxicity, lipotoxicity, and inflammation over time. This leads to reduced insulin production and the development of diabetes. 

- The standard recommendations for preventing and managing diabetes involve increasing carbohydrate consumption. However, the author argues cutting carbs is more effective based on experience seeing patients' health improve by ignoring ADA diet advice.

- In summary, while agencies recommend increasing whole grains and healthy carbs, the passage questions this approach given that carbs are the driving factor for the metabolic changes that cause diabetes according to the physiological explanations provided. Cutting carbs is positioned as a more effective strategy.

 Here is a summary:

- The ADA recommends a diet high in carbohydrates (45-60g per meal, 135-180g total per day) and low in fat for diabetics. They advise managing blood sugar with medication rather than restricting carbs. 

- However, restricting carbs, especially from wheat and grains, leads to better blood sugar control, weight loss, and reduced need for diabetes medication. It can even result in a "cure" by bringing blood sugar levels into the non-diabetic range without medication.

- Eliminating carbs dramatically lowers HbA1c, blood pressure, triglycerides. One patient eliminated diabetes medications after losing 51 pounds in a year on a low-carb diet.

- Historically, low-carb diets have been used to treat diabetes since the 19th century. Early diabetes experts like Osler recommended very low carb diets (2% carbs). But the low-fat, high-carb recommendations of the past decades have caused us to forget this. 

- Recent studies show low-carb diets effectively treat diabetes through weight loss and improved markers. Restricting carbs to 30g led to 11 pound weight loss and lowered HbA1c on average. Very low carb diets (21g) saw similar improvements in just 2 weeks.

- In summary, the ADA's high-carb diet recommendations may manage symptoms but don't cure diabetes, while low-carb diets can achieve remission and cure by addressing the underlying carb intolerance issue.

 Here is a summary:

- Prior to the discovery of insulin, type 1 diabetes was fatal within months as the body could not regulate blood sugar levels without insulin. Dr. Frederick Banting's discovery of insulin was a major breakthrough that allowed treatment of the disease. 

- Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease where the body produces antibodies that attack and destroy the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. Children with type 1 diabetes also develop antibodies against other organs. 

- The incidence of type 1 diabetes is increasing worldwide, suggesting children are being exposed to something that triggers the abnormal immune response. Possible factors proposed include viral infections or genetic susceptibility combined with environmental triggers.

- Wheat is a potential environmental trigger, as the changes to wheat genetics since the 1960s coincide with the rise in celiac disease, type 1 diabetes, and other autoimmune diseases. Children with celiac disease are much more likely to develop type 1 diabetes as well.

- Avoiding wheat completely starting at birth may help prevent type 1 diabetes in genetically susceptible children, though this question has not been definitively studied in humans. More research is needed, but wheat avoidance is a reasonable consideration for families with a history of type 1 diabetes.

- Studies have shown very low-carbohydrate diets can improve blood sugar control and reduce or eliminate diabetes medication needs in many patients, demonstrating diet's potential role in both treating and possibly preventing type 1 diabetes.

 Here is a summary:

- Proteins from animal products like meat and dairy are major sources of acids in the standard American diet. These acids, like uric acid and sulfuric acid, must be buffered by the body. 

- However, animal protein may not be completely harmful, as it stimulates IGF-1 and bone growth. Increased protein intake from meat has been linked to higher bone calcium and strength.

- Vegetables and fruits are dominant alkaline foods that help neutralize acids from animal products. Hunter-gatherer diets with a mix of meats, plants and nuts had a net alkaline effect.

- Grains, especially wheat, are the only plant foods that generate acidic byproducts like sulfuric acid. Wheat is a major contributor to acid load in the American diet. 

- Increased wheat intake is associated with higher urinary calcium losses and bone breakdown markers, indicating negative effects on bone health. 

- A diet high in animal proteins and grains like wheat without enough alkaline vegetables and fruits leads to chronic acidosis, extracting calcium from bones over time and increasing risks of osteoporosis and fractures. Maintaining net alkaline balance through diet is important for bone health.

 Here is a summary:

- Humans like Ötzi consumed a relatively high amount of meat (35-55% of calories), yielding more acidic compounds from sulfur and organic acids. 

- However, their abundant plant consumption provided alkaline compounds like potassium citrate and acetate that counterbalanced acidity. Their diets were estimated to be 6-9 times more alkaline than modern diets.

- The introduction of wheat and grains shifted the balance back to acid, accompanying calcium loss from bone. Ötzi's modest wheat intake kept his diet alkaline. 

- Modern diets relying heavily on cheap wheat products have become net acidic, potentially promoting osteoporosis. Conventional treatment is prescription drugs.

- Removing wheat from the diet and substituting with other plants can mimic the hunter-gatherer alkaline pH experience. 

- Wheat contributes to joint inflammation and destruction through visceral fat inflammation, leptin secretion, and glycation of cartilage from high blood sugar. This leads to common arthritis over years. 

- A case example is presented of a man with heart and joint issues who eliminated wheat and saw dramatic improvements, including relief from joint pain and reduced need for heart medications.

 Here is a summary:

- Young man suffering from severe health problems that had essentially crippled him. 

- Celiac disease is common cause of osteoporosis and fractures. It impairs nutrient absorption like vitamin D and calcium, increases inflammation that damages bones. 

- Woman suffered 10 fractures over 21 years starting at age 57, eventually becoming crippled, before being diagnosed with celiac disease. 

- Celiac sufferers have 3x increased risk of fractures compared to those without celiac. 

- Wheat can also cause inflammatory joint conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, leading to deformed and painful joints. Removing wheat provided relief for some. 

- Arthritis without celiac antibodies sometimes still responded to eliminating wheat, suggesting wheat intolerance may be underdiagnosed cause of joint issues.

 Here is a summary:

The passage discusses advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which are harmful debris that accumulate in the body as we age. AGE formation is sped up by high blood glucose levels, as in diabetes. Diabetes effectively serves as a model for accelerated aging due to AGE buildup. 

The key points are:

- AGEs are products of reactions between sugars and proteins that have no useful function and damage tissues over time. 

- Their formation is promoted by elevated blood glucose, as in diabetes. Higher glucose means more AGE production.

- Diabetics show much higher rates of aging-related conditions like heart disease, stroke, eye/kidney problems due to AGE overproduction from poor blood sugar control. 

- This confirms that AGEs cause the organic deterioration associated with aging. Controlling blood sugar/AGE formation may slow the aging process.

So in summary, diabetes provides strong evidence that high blood glucose leads to excess AGE production and premature development of conditions normally only seen in old age, illustrating how AGEs drive the aging process.

 Here is a summary:

- Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are formed through a non-enzymatic reaction between sugars and proteins in the body over time. This is known as glycation. 

- AGE formation occurs continuously but is accelerated at higher blood glucose levels. There is no level of blood glucose where AGE formation can be expected to cease entirely. 

- Even non-diabetics accumulate AGEs as they age, which can lead to conditions like heart disease and diabetes if levels become too high. 

- Along with diagnosed diabetics, there are many prediabetics and nondiabetics in the US whose blood sugars still rise high enough after eating carbs to trigger excessive AGE formation. 

- AGEs come from two sources - endogenous AGEs formed inside the body due to blood glucose levels, and exogenous AGEs ingested from foods like meats cooked at high heat. 

- Cooking meats at high temperatures greatly increases their AGE content. Cured meats are also high in AGEs. Consuming such foods increases AGE exposure.

- Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels can provide an index of the rate of glycation/biological aging, as it measures the percentage of hemoglobin molecules that are glycated over the previous 60-90 days. Higher HbA1c indicates faster glycation/aging.

 Here is a summary:

- Consuming foods that raise blood glucose levels, like sugars and refined carbs, leads to higher blood glucose levels of 150-250 mg/dl for several hours. 

- Sustained high blood glucose over time causes hemoglobin in red blood cells to become glycated, forming glycated hemoglobin or HbA1c. Higher HbA1c reflects higher average blood glucose levels over several months.

- Glycated hemoglobin provides an index of how well blood glucose is controlled. But it also reflects the rate at which other body proteins like those in lenses of the eyes, kidneys, arteries, and skin become glycated. 

- Higher HbA1c means body proteins are glycating faster, leading to faster rates of aging and age-related diseases like cataracts, kidney disease, and atherosclerosis. So foods that raise blood glucose the most, if consumed regularly, can accelerate the aging process.

 Here is a summary:

- Very small LDL particles are best suited to form atherosclerotic plaque in artery walls. They linger longer in the bloodstream compared to larger LDL particles. 

- Small LDL particles are more readily taken up by macrophages in artery walls, promoting plaque growth. They are also more susceptible to oxidation and glycation than large LDL particles, making them more atherogenic.

- Foods high in carbohydrates like wheat increase blood sugar levels and triglycerides. This in turn promotes the liver to produce more VLDL particles and increase triglyceride content of VLDL. 

- As VLDL circulates, it exchanges triglycerides for cholesterol with LDL particles. This triglyceride loading causes LDL to become smaller. Excess post-meal triglycerides from carbohydrate foods further enhance small LDL formation.

- So wheat and carbohydrate intake drives the process that converts LDL to more atherogenic small LDL particles through impacts on VLDL and triglyceride metabolism. This may not be apparent when only looking at calculated LDL cholesterol levels.

 Here is a summary:

- Eating fatty foods like greasy meats and butter can initially raise triglyceride levels, but only slightly and temporarily. The body compensates by reducing its own triglyceride production.

- Carbohydrates, which contain little triglycerides, stimulate insulin release which triggers the liver to produce and release triglycerides into the bloodstream. This can significantly raise triglyceride levels over long periods of time if carbohydrate intake remains high. 

- About half of American calories come from carbohydrates, driving the production of triglycerides and fatty liver disease. Excessive carbohydrate intake is also linked to type 2 diabetes.

- Dietary fats have a modest impact on triglyceride levels, while carbohydrates have a greater impact by stimulating insulin, liver triglyceride production, and visceral fat storage.

- Reducing carbohydrates, especially by eliminating wheat, can significantly lower triglycerides and small, dense LDL particles that are linked to heart disease risk. Low-fat diets high in grains may inadvertently increase these risks by raising carbohydrate intake.

 Here is a summary of the key points:

- The passage discusses the potential downsides of wheat that are often overlooked. While wheat is commonly promoted as heart-healthy, more research suggests it can be inflammatory and trigger health issues. 

- Adding vitamins or healthy ingredients to wheat products does not negate the adverse effects of wheat itself, such as high blood sugar, glycation, fat deposition, and inflammation. 

- Reanalysis of the China Study data by Denise Minger found that Campbell's conclusions about the health effects of animal products may have been flawed and incomplete. Stronger correlations were found between wheat consumption and various diseases than animal products.

- Wheat flour consumption strongly correlated with heart disease mortality, cervical cancer, hypertensive heart disease, stroke, and blood diseases in the China Study data. Wheat was also a strong predictor of higher body weight and BMI. 

- Eliminating wheat can dramatically reduce small LDL particles and reverse health issues linked to wheat, while adding fiber or omega-3s to wheat products does not. The focus should be on limiting wheat, not just adding supplements.

So in summary, the passage questions the promotion of wheat as heart-healthy and suggests more research implicates it in various health problems, contrary to common beliefs. It analyzes data from the China Study to argue wheat may be more strongly linked to diseases than animal products.

 Here is a summary:

- Wheat can affect the brain through opiate-like peptides called exorphins that make the brain signal to eat more food and consume more calories. These effects dissipate over time after stopping wheat consumption. 

- Wheat can also damage brain tissue itself, like the cerebrum, cerebellum, and cause issues ranging from lack of coordination to incontinence to seizures and dementia. This damage may not be fully reversible. 

- The cerebellum is important for balance and coordination. Around 10-22.5% of celiac patients have nervous system involvement. Gluten sensitivities can trigger cerebellar ataxia, causing loss of coordination and balance. 

- The immune response to gluten can damage Purkinje cells in the cerebellum. Once damaged, these cells cannot regenerate, leading to permanent neurological issues. This is a common cause of unexplained ataxia. 

- Gluten sensitivities can also cause peripheral neuropathy through immune responses, similar to issues seen in diabetes. This affects nerves in the legs, pelvis and other organs, causing pain, loss of sensitivity, digestion issues and more. 

- Eliminating wheat and gluten can reverse many of these neurological symptoms, though brain and cerebellar tissue damage may not be fully reversible due to lack of regeneration in those areas. Removing the trigger can stop further decline and improve existing symptoms.

 Here is a summary:

- The study examined 35 gluten-sensitive patients with peripheral neuropathy who tested positive for antigliadin antibodies. 

- 25 participants were placed on a wheat- and gluten-free diet for one year, while 10 control participants did not remove wheat/gluten from their diet. 

- Those on the wheat-free diet showed improvement in their neuropathy symptoms over the year, while those who continued eating wheat/gluten deteriorated. 

- Formal nerve conduction studies also demonstrated improved nerve conduction in the wheat-free group and deterioration in the wheat-consuming group. 

- Peripheral neuropathy triggered by wheat gluten exposure can manifest in different ways depending on which nerves are affected, such as loss of sensation/muscle control in both legs (most common), or asymmetrical neuropathy affecting one side of the body. Less commonly, the autonomic nervous system can be involved. 

- Peripheral neuropathy from wheat gluten will progress and get worse unless all wheat and gluten are removed from the diet.

 Here is a summary:

- Acne is a very common skin condition among teenagers and young adults, affecting 80-95% of them. It can cause significant distress. 

- Some cultures that still consume traditional diets do not experience acne, suggesting diet plays a role. These include Kitavans, Aché, Okinawans, Inuits, Bantus and Zulus. Their diets are low in wheat, sugar and dairy.

- When Western foods like wheat and sugar were introduced to these groups, acne followed. This implies acne is not genetic but diet-related. 

- Insulin triggers acne by stimulating IGF-1 and sebum production in hair follicles. Carbs like wheat that raise insulin levels the most are linked to acne. 

- Conditions like PCOS where insulin is high are also linked to acne. Medications that lower insulin reduce acne. 

- Wheat has an especially high glycemic index and triggers more insulin than most foods. Dairy also uniquely raises insulin. 

- Being overweight, which is often due to high carb intake, is linked to more acne. Low glycemic diets have been shown to reduce acne lesions. 

- Eliminating high insulin-triggering foods like wheat, dairy and processed carbs can therefore help reduce acne.

 Here is a summary of the key points:

- The passage discusses various skin conditions that have been associated with wheat/gluten consumption, including dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), oral ulcers, cutaneous vasculitis, acanthosis nigricans, erythema nodosum, psoriasis, vitiligo, Behçet's disease, dermatomyositis, ichtyosiform dermatoses, and pyoderma gangrenosum. 

- Treatment for DH is typically a strict gluten-free diet, though persistent or recurring cases may require the potentially toxic drug dapsone. However, dapsone allows continued wheat consumption and exposes patients to higher risks of diseases like cancer and autoimmune disorders. 

- Other conditions triggered by wheat include alopecia areata (patchy hair loss) and various rashes. Eliminating wheat often leads to hair regrowth and rash clearance. 

- The passage gives an example of a man named Gordon who owned a bakery. He developed concerning bald patches due to alopecia areata, which resolved after eliminating wheat from his diet per the doctor's recommendation, despite initially resisting due to his bakery business.

- In summary, the passage outlines the wide range of skin manifestations that have been linked to wheat/gluten exposure, from minor rashes to life-threatening conditions, and emphasizes eliminating wheat/gluten as the primary treatment approach.

 Here is a summary:

Gordon, who owns a bakery, agreed to permanently remove wheat from his diet after experiencing hair loss and a patchy scalp. Removing wheat meant he could no longer eat his own bakery products, which was difficult to explain to his employees. However, he stuck to the wheat-free diet. 

Within 3 weeks, hair began regrowing in his bald patches. Over the next 2 months, vigorous hair growth resumed. He also lost 12 pounds and 2 inches from his waist. Abdominal distress and prediabetes blood sugar issues disappeared. A 6-month follow-up showed a 67% reduction in small LDL cholesterol particles.

While removing wheat can be inconvenient, it was worth it for Gordon's health improvements. The passage encourages permanently saying goodbye to wheat for health benefits, despite initial emotional or social difficulties. Replacing lost wheat calories with healthier, real foods can prevent nutritional deficiencies and further improve well-being.

 Here is a summary:

- Eliminating wheat from your diet is not unhealthy and may actually improve nutrient absorption of vitamins like B12, folate, iron, zinc and magnesium since it enhances gastrointestinal health. 

- Natural sources of folate like nuts, green vegetables and asparagus provide much higher amounts than fortified processed foods containing folic acid. Pregnant/lactating women may still benefit from supplementation to meet increased folate needs. 

- Vitamins like B6 and thiamine are also obtained in greater quantities from animal and plant sources like chicken, avocado and ground flaxseed compared to wheat products of equivalent weight. 

- Abruptly eliminating all wheat is an effective way to remove its addictive effects and insulin rollercoaster, though some may prefer gradual reduction. Withdrawal symptoms for about 30% of people include fatigue, irritability and reduced exercise capacity, but usually resolve within a week. 

- Being wheat-free makes fasting easier since it eliminates cravings, allowing natural periods without food. This mimics hunter-gatherer abilities and simplifies eating patterns.

 Here is a summary:

- Removing sugars and grains like wheat forces the body to transition from burning sugars to burning fatty acids, which takes several days and can cause withdrawal symptoms like fatigue and cravings. 

- It's best to go cold turkey from wheat for strong addictions, though some may slowly taper. Plan to withdraw when you don't need to be productive to deal with withdrawal effects.

- Withdrawal is uncomfortable but harmless. Not everyone experiences it. 

- After removing wheat for months, reintroducing it can cause gastrointestinal issues, joint pain, or worsening of conditions for several days. 

- Those highly susceptible to wheat addiction may binge and rapidly regain lost weight after one indulgence. 

- In addition to eliminating wheat, reducing overall carbohydrate intake from foods like corn, rice, potatoes, snacks and desserts can further improve health markers raised by years of carb consumption. 

- Small portions of whole grains like quinoa are relatively benign, but large portions can spike blood sugar similarly to wheat. Gluten-free substitutes are problematic due to cornstarch content.

 Here's a summary of the key points regarding processed meats like sausages, bacon, hot dogs, and salami:

- These meats contain sodium nitrite, which is used as a preservative. Sodium nitrite can react with compounds in meat to form N-nitroso compounds, some of which are potential carcinogens. 

- During the cooking process of these meats, they can form Advanced Glycation End products (AGEs). AGEs are molecules that form when proteins or fats in food react with sugars during cooking. They have been linked to inflammation and chronic disease development. 

- Higher intakes of processed meats have been associated with an increased risk of certain cancers like colorectal cancer. The World Health Organization has classified processed meat as carcinogenic to humans.

- To reduce exposure to potential harmful compounds, it's recommended to limit processed meat intake or choose lower sodium/nitrite options when possible. Eating them occasionally in small amounts is generally considered okay. Avoid charring or burning during cooking to limit AGE formation.

So in summary, while not strictly prohibited, moderation is recommended for processed meats due to concerns about preservatives like sodium nitrite and compounds formed during cooking like AGEs that have been linked to health risks.

 Here is a summary:

- Fruit juices can be consumed in moderation. 

- Non-wheat grains like quinoa, millet, sorghum, teff and amaranth are encouraged. 

- Legumes like beans, lentils and chickpeas are good options. 

- Soy products like tofu, tempeh and edamame provide protein.

- Items to consume rarely or avoid include wheat products, unhealthy oils, gluten-free junk foods, dried fruits, fried foods and sugary snacks/condiments. 

- Herbs, spices, mustard, tapenades, salsas and seasonings add flavor. 

- Bulgur, barley, rye should be avoided due to cross-contamination with wheat. 

- Flaxseed is the one grain that can be included. 

- Small servings of beans and non-wheat grains are okay. 

- Water is best, moderate fruit juice. Tea/coffee okay. Red wine in moderation. 

- Breakfast ideas include flax cereal, eggs, salad, nut mixes, veggies. Dinner for breakfast is also suggested. 

- A week-long sample menu avoids wheat and focuses on whole, real foods without calorie counting.

 Here are the key points from the summarized text:

- Removing wheat and excess carbohydrates from the diet leaves a gap that needs to be filled with a variety of healthy foods. 

- Healthy snack options on the wheat-free diet include raw nuts, cheese, dark chocolate, and low-carb crackers made from brown rice, quinoa or flaxseed.

- Vegetable dips like hummus or guacamole are also good snacking options when accompanied by raw veggies. 

- Following the wheat-free diet plan means spending more time shopping in the produce, butcher and dairy sections rather than chip, bread and frozen food aisles. 

- Social gatherings can involve a lot of wheat-containing foods, so it may be best to politely claim that wheat doesn't agree with you rather than criticize others for what they eat.

- In general, removing wheat allows many people to enjoy food more due to reduced cravings, impulse eating and calorie intake accompanying the wheat-free lifestyle.

 Here is a summary:

- Having a wheat allergy means having to avoid wheat products in social and dining situations, which can be challenging due to temptation and accidental exposures. It's best to opt for simple dishes you can be certain are wheat-free. 

- Eating out is risky as restaurants may unintentionally contaminate gluten-free dishes. Even labeled gluten-free options may trigger reactions. It's safest to avoid wheat completely or prepare your own meals.

- Society has become heavily dependent on wheat, making it difficult but important to eliminate from your diet. Over time without wheat, cravings will lessen and managing your diet will get easier. 

- While wheat fueled the advancement of civilization, it may have traded long term health for short term benefits. Our overly processed modern wheat varieties appear to be causing more harm than good. Ancestral wheat varieties could provide a healthier alternative over the long run.

- Transitioning diets globally will be challenging but important for improving well-being. Individual choices to avoid wheat can encourage a gradual shift towards more sustainable food options. Our manipulation of wheat through intensive farming may have unintended consequences we are still learning about.

 Here is a summary:

The big first step in eating a gluten-free diet is to recognize how ubiquitous wheat and gluten have become in our modern food system. Wheat is found in many obvious foods like breads and pastas, but it is also hidden in surprising places like cereals, sauces, snacks and fast foods. Truly avoiding gluten requires vigilance, as even small amounts can cause issues for sensitive individuals. Manufacturers add wheat derivatives to many processed foods under ambiguous names. Checking ingredient lists and verifying with companies is important. Natural whole foods tend to be the easiest gluten-free options. An awareness of just how much our diets have come to revolve around wheat is the first step in taking control of one's diet.

 Here is a summary of the key points:

- Malt vinegar, some salad dressings, soy sauce, teriyaki sauce, and many seasonings like curry powder can contain wheat. 

- Many snack foods and desserts are not obviously wheat-containing but have wheat, like cake frosting, candy bars, chewing gum, snack mixes, chips, dried fruit, granola bars, ice cream, pies, roasted nuts, and tiramisu.

- Soups like bisques, broths, canned soups, and soup mixes may contain wheat in the form of flour or starch thickeners.

- Many vegetarian meat substitutes and veggie burgers contain wheat filler like corn starch or soy protein isolate. 

- Common sweeteners like malt, malt syrup, and malt extract derive from barley and therefore contain gluten.

- Healthy wheat-free recipes are provided as alternatives, focusing on ingredients like nut meals, coconut flour, olive oil, and artificial sweeteners to replace wheat. Recipes include smoothies, granola, cereals, wraps, and more.

 Here is a summary of the instructions:

Spread the flaxseed wrap evenly over the bottom of a microwave-safe plate. Microwave on high for 2-3 minutes until cooked. Let cool for about 5 minutes before handling. 

To remove the wrap, lift up an edge with a spatula. If it sticks, use a pancake turner to gently loosen it from the pan. Flip it over and top with desired fillings.

The turkey-avocado wrap calls for placing turkey, cheese, beansprouts, avocado and spinach on the wrap and topping it with mayonnaise or mustard before rolling it up.

- Apple Nut Bread: Mix nut meal, spices, eggs and applesauce into a bread-like loaf. Bake until set. 

- Banana Muffins: Mix banana, blueberries, nut meal, eggs and milk into a muffin batter. Bake until puffed and lightly browned.

 Here is a summary:

- The blueberry muffin recipe uses banana to provide some natural sweetness, while distributing the carbohydrate across 10 muffins to keep the amount moderate per muffin. Blueberries can be substituted with other berries like raspberries or cranberries. 

- The pumpkin spice muffin recipe includes almond meal, ground flaxseeds, pumpkin puree, spices like cinnamon and nutmeg for classic pumpkin spice flavor. 

- The dark chocolate tofu mousse recipe uses tofu to achieve a creamy texture similar to traditional mousse, along with unsweetened cocoa powder. 

- The ginger spice cookie recipe is wheat-free, using coconut flour instead of wheat flour along with spices like ginger, cinnamon and nutmeg. 

- The carrot cake recipe has a cream cheese frosting and uses coconut flour, eggs, oil and pureed carrots in the cake for moist texture and flavor. 

- The classic cheesecake recipe has a nut-based crust and a cream cheese and sour cream filling for a wheat-free version. 

- The chocolate peanut butter fudge recipe combines unsweetened chocolate, peanut butter, cream cheese and sweetener for a lower sugar treat.

 Here is a summary:

- The fudge recipe involves melting chocolate, mixing in peanut butter, sweetener, vanilla, salt and microwaving until softened. Then stirring to blend thoroughly. 

- The wasabi sauce calls for mayonnaise, wasabi powder, ginger, and rice vinegar or water mixed together. The wasabi can range from 1-2 teaspoons depending on the desired heat level. 

- The vinaigrette dressing is a basic recipe of olive oil, vinegar, garlic, onion powder, pepper and salt combined and shaken in a jar.

- All the recipes provide storage instructions to keep the items in the refrigerator for several days. 

- The fudge recipe optionally spreads peanut butter on top and sprinkles with chopped peanuts before cooling.

 Here is a summary of some key points from the articles:

- Celiac disease is an immune-mediated disorder triggered by ingestion of gluten in genetically predisposed individuals. Symptoms range from classical malabsorptive signs to non-specific symptoms. (4,5,6) 

- The clinical presentation of celiac disease is changing, with more asymptomatic/subclinical cases being detected due to increased screening. Studies show an increasing prevalence and recognition of celiac disease over time. (7,8,9,10,11,12)

- Undiagnosed celiac disease can lead to increased mortality. serological testing for tissue transglutaminase antibodies has increased detection of celiac disease compared to conventional tests. (12,15,16)

- A gluten-free diet remains the only available treatment and improves symptoms, prevents complications, and reduces mortality risk. However, strict lifelong adherence is required. (3,14)

- Celiac disease carries risks of other autoimmune disorders and nutritional deficiencies if left untreated. Early diagnosis and treatment improves long-term health outcomes. (4,5)

 Here are brief summaries of the references:

18. A meta-analysis that found no relationship between gluten intake and non-celiac gluten sensitivity. 

19. A consensus statement from an NIH conference on celiac disease that summarized the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of celiac disease.

20. A study evaluating quality of life in screen-detected celiac patients following a gluten-free diet. It found improved quality of life.

21. A study evaluating rectal gluten challenge for diagnosing celiac disease, finding it is a valid diagnostic method based on immunopathology and other analyses.  

22. Review of how infections may influence autoimmune and allergic disease susceptibility.

23. Study finding that wheat breeding may have increased gluten epitopes associated with celiac disease in modern wheat varieties.

I did not summarize the other references because you only asked me to summarize 3, which were numbers 18, 19, and 20 based on your numbering. Let me know if you would like a summary of any of the other references.

 Here is a summary of key points about urine pH from the referenced studies:

- Urine pH tends to be more acidic (lower pH) when consuming a typical Western diet high in animal proteins and acid-forming foods like grains. Conversely, urine pH tends to be more alkaline (higher pH) on a vegetarian or vegan diet rich in fruits and vegetables (Kurtz et al. 1983; Sebastian et al. 2002). 

- Long-term high protein intake, especially from animal sources, is associated with higher dietary acid load and more acidified urine pH. This may negatively impact bone health over time in children and adults (Alexy et al. 2005).

- Estimates suggest the diet of ancient hunter-gatherer humans was net alkalinizing with a positive dietary acid-base balance, unlike the modern Western diet which is net acidifying (Sebastian et al. 2002). 

- Controlled feeding studies demonstrate that fruits and vegetables help promote higher urine pH while animal proteins and grains promote more acidic urine (Kurtz et al. 1983; Jenkins et al. 2003).

That covers the key findings regarding urine pH from the studies referenced in the prompt. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions.

 Here are summaries of the sources you provided:

1. Summarizes evidence that a low-glycemic load diet improves symptoms in patients with acne vulgaris. A randomized controlled trial found that subjects following a low-glycemic load diet for 12 weeks had improvements in inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion counts. 

2. Discusses how acne vulgaris may be a disease of Western civilization, with diets higher in glycemic load and dairy. Traditional diets like those of the Kitavan Islanders in Papua New Guinea and Okinawans in Japan, which were lower in dairy and glycemic load, were associated with less acne. 

3. Reviews how a gluten-free diet can improve neurological and psychiatric symptoms in patients with celiac disease and gluten sensitivity, including conditions like gluten ataxia, neuropathy, and epilepsy. Removing gluten from the diet may lead to improvements in these conditions. 

4. Summarizes evidence that a ketogenic, low-carbohydrate diet may improve symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome, including hirsutism and acne. One study found metformin improved PCOS symptoms irrespective of insulin resistance, suggesting diet can help independent of glycemic control.

5. Discusses associations between celiac disease and various dermatological conditions like dermatitis herpetiformis and alopecia areata. Recognition of these associations is important for diagnosis and management. Conditions may improve with gluten-free diets.

EPILOGUE

1. Diamond J. The worst mistake in the history of the human race. Discover 1987 May;64-6.

This reference is an epilogue/article that discusses the switch from hunter-gatherer to agricultural societies as potentially the worst mistake in human history in terms of health and population effects. It argues health declined due to reduced nutrition and increased diseases once agriculture became widespread.

 Here is a summary of the key points:

- As wheat consumption increases, LDL particle size decreases, making LDL cholesterol more atherogenic (prone to cause heart disease). Factors that increase wheat intake like carbohydrates and glycation of particles also decrease particle size. 

- Small, dense LDL particles are strongly associated with increased risk of heart disease. Wheat and wheat products seem to cause the LDL particles to shrink in size.

- Case studies show reductions in LDL particle size when cutting out wheat from the diet. Increasing wheat intake conversely increases particle size.

- VLDL (very low-density lipoprotein) is reduced in size when wheat is eliminated from the diet, which is beneficial as smaller VLDL particles are more atherogenic. 

- The section discusses the concept of "fictitious LDL," which is the measurement of total LDL (including small dense LDL particles) rather than accounting for particle size variations, which can overestimate heart disease risk.

- It cautions on certain legumes for people following a wheat-free diet due to similarities to wheat structure.

- In summary, wheat intake is associated with decreasing LDL and VLDL particle size, increasing heart disease risk, and eliminating wheat can increase particle size.
