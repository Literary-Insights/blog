 Here is a summary of the prelude chapter:

The prelude opens by describing the scene on the first day of the Main Event of the World Series of Poker in Las Vegas. Thousands of players fill the room, which has a worn, dated aesthetic. There is a nervous tension in the air. Most players have been eliminated, but some remain, focused on surviving to play the next day. 

One table stands out - seat six is empty, but there are piles of chips in front of it, slowly being whittled down each hand by the blinds and antes. The author reveals this was her seat - she paid the $10,000 buy-in but is not there playing. Instead, she is curled up sick in the bathroom, suffering from what she suspects is a migraine. 

The author reflects on why she got into poker in the first place - to understand the line between skill and luck and what she could control versus what she couldn't. But here was a lesson that despite all her preparation, she couldn't control getting sick and chance had intervened. The cards would keep being dealt whether she was there or not. The prelude ends with this message that she could plan all she wanted, but ultimately many things were out of her control.

 

- The author is nervous about meeting poker champion Erik Seidel to ask him to be her mentor for a year and train her for the World Series of Poker, even though she has never played poker before. 

- Seidel is an unusual poker pro - quiet, intellectual, cultured, and not flashy or ego-driven like many others. He has maintained his success for over 30 years in a game that has become much more mathematical and data-driven. 

- Seidel's passion for life and constant curiosity impress the author. He exposes her to new cultural experiences and keeps her from becoming lazy or jaded. 

- The author first learned about Seidel from the movie Rounders, which featured his famous 1988 final table match against Johnny Chan at the World Series of Poker. Though Seidel lost, it was the start of his prolific career. 

- The author is drawn to the psychological aspects of poker exemplified in that match - "playing the man, not the cards." She hopes Seidel can teach her those skills over the next year as she trains for the World Series of Poker despite having never played poker before.

 

- The author had planned to spend a year playing poker with Erik in order to learn about making good decisions under uncertainty. However, life had other plans that shifted the framework. 

- The author has long been interested in disentangling how much of one's life trajectory is due to skill versus sheer luck. This relates to the philosophical question of free will versus determinism.

- As part of her doctoral research, the author ran studies where people invested money in simulated stocks. She found that people often overestimated their degree of control and ignored signs that their approach wasn't working. The illusion of control prevented them from adapting their strategy.

- Humans struggle with probabilities and statistics. We rely more on personal experience and intuition than data. This "description-experience gap" leads us to make suboptimal decisions.

- The balance between skill and luck in life remains a complex question. The author aimed to gain insight into making the best decisions possible despite the inherent uncertainty and randomness.

 

- The author discusses how chance and skill are difficult to disentangle in everyday life. She gives examples of bad luck befalling her family in 2015 - her mother losing her job, her grandmother dying from a fall, her husband's startup failing. 

- This led the author to think about the role of chance versus skill in life outcomes. Some see pure chance and statistics, others attribute emotional meanings like luck or fate. 

- The author reads von Neumann's Theory of Games and Economic Behavior, in which poker is used as an example of the balance between skill and chance that governs life. 

- Von Neumann believed if he could figure out how to maximize skill and minimize the role of chance in poker, he could solve many of life's challenges in decision making. 

- Poker mirrors life because it involves both chance and skill. Anyone can get lucky or unlucky in the short term, but over time, skill prevails. There are mathematical foundations but also human psychology and deception.

- The author implies poker can be used to help understand how to control outcomes in an uncertain world, by systematically developing skill and minimizing the role of chance.

 

- The author was inspired by John von Neumann's view of poker as the perfect strategic simulation of life. Poker involves making decisions with incomplete information, just like in real life. 

- No Limit Texas Hold'em was chosen as the ideal form of poker to learn from. It strikes the right balance between skill and chance with two private hole cards and five public community cards. The no-limit betting allows the full range of actions, just like in real life where there are no limits. 

- Tournaments were chosen over cash games due to their accelerated timeframe, where decisions have greater consequences. This makes them a useful proxy for life.

- The author wondered if learning poker could help make better decisions in real life situations involving chance, like careers and finances. 

- To find out, the author arranged to meet top professional poker player Erik Seidel to get advice on how to succeed at the game. Seidel has won many major titles over his 30+ year career.

 Here are the key points:

- The author, a psychologist, convinces professional poker player Erik Seidel to teach her how to play poker from scratch. She wants to test whether an understanding of psychology and human behavior can overcome the mathematical skills of other players. 

- Seidel agrees to train her, intrigued by her psychology background and language abilities. He believes thinking skills are more important than math skills in poker.

- The author has studied decision-making and wants to apply those skills to poker. She believes her outsider perspective will help her learn effectively. 

- Seidel aims to train the author to not just play poker but to win, even making it to the final table of the World Series of Poker main event. He wants to prove the power of a psychology-based approach over pure math skills.

- For the author, this is a test of life philosophy and decision-making, not just a poker challenge. She feels a responsibility not to let Seidel down after he has generously taken her on.

- The journey was meant to last a year but became a new life. The author went from novice to champion and amateur to professional. The book explores poker as a lens into life's most difficult decisions involving chance and skill.

 

- The author's grandmother disapproves of the author's decision to pursue poker, equating it with ruinous gambling. 

- There is a common misperception that poker is pure gambling rather than a game of skill. But poker involves constant decision-making and reading of opponents, unlike true games of chance. 

- In poker, you can win with a poor hand and lose with a strong one. The best player, not the best cards, often wins. This makes it fundamentally different from other casino games.

- Economists have analyzed large datasets of poker hands and found clear differences in skill between players. The best players consistently make money.

- Betting is core to poker, but it enables the back-and-forth, interpretive dance of skill. Maximizing money won and minimizing losses relies on reading people and situations. 

- The author aims to justify poker as a valuable learning tool, not pure gambling. Mastering poker teaches decision-making skills applicable far beyond the tables.

 Here are the key points:

- Betting forces us to honestly evaluate how confident we really are in our opinions. As Kant argued, putting something at stake makes us reconsider how sure we are of a "sure thing."

- Nate Silver is good at election forecasting because of his poker background, which taught him probabilistic thinking. Most people see 71% as basically 100%, but poker teaches you that 29% odds happen frequently. 

- Professionals like fund managers and investors often ignore statistical information and rely on intuition, to their detriment. Their decision-making is often just "rolling dice."

- Poker provides immediate feedback on probabilistic judgments, so you learn quickly. Other areas of life often let you blame outside factors when you're wrong.

- Lawyers paid on contingency and meteorologists tend to calibrate probabilities well because they get direct feedback on accuracy.

- The first pioneer of probability theory, Gerolamo Cardano, was a prolific gambler. Gambling teaches useful skills in probabilistic thinking that apply well beyond the tables.

 

- Girolamo Cardano was an Italian mathematician who realized in the 16th century that you could predict outcomes based on calculating probabilities rather than relying on astrology or divination. He wrote one of the first known books on probability and also described an early form of poker known as primero. 

- Cardano lamented that understanding probability wasn't enough to overcome the role of luck in gambling. You need to cheat to consistently win. His work showed probability was useful for understanding but not for practical play.

- The game of poker spread from primero in Europe to poque in France to poker in America, likely gaining popularity in New Orleans. So the theory of probability traveled alongside the evolution of poker.

- Poker is a game of skill and incomplete information, unlike games like chess with perfect information. Life itself is full of uncertainty, so in many ways poker is the more skilled endeavor compared to an academic career path which can be subject to the whims of chance.

- The narrator is trying to convince her grandmother that poker is a respectable pursuit. Her grandmother thinks it's just gambling and wishes she had taken up chess instead. But chess in Washington Square Park also involves intense betting.

- Mentors like Dan Harrington, poker champion and author, are crucial for learning this new skill. Harrington connects the narrator back to Erik Seidel, showing how the poker world is a tight-knit community passing on knowledge between generations.

 

- The author met poker legend Dan Harrington for breakfast and bonded over their similar upbringings and supportive yet skeptical parents. 

- Harrington emphasized the importance of failure, recalling how his mother was more impressed by a distant cousin winning a small golf tournament than Harrington's World Series of Poker win.

- The author had diligently read and annotated Harrington's poker books per her mentor Erik's instructions before playing any real hands. This was the first step in her journey to play in the WSOP Main Event in 10 months. 

- Harrington acknowledged the author's book knowledge but stressed that failure is a crucial part of learning poker. Experience and failure teach more than books.

- The author and Erik have lengthy walking sessions to discuss the books, as Erik determines if she has a sufficient theoretical base before playing for real money online. She is eager to play but has to follow his step-by-step guidance.

- Their early conversations covered poker fundamentals like starting hand selection. The author wondered why you wouldn't always want to play aggressively like Harrington recommends, and Erik explained the value of balancing various approaches.

 Here are the key points from the conversation between the author and Dan Harrington:

- Erik explains that hyper-aggressive poker play can be effective in the short term, but most hyper-aggressive players eventually go broke. You need to find the right balance of aggression. 

- Dan agrees, noting that many past poker stars were too aggressive and now have no money. You have to be able to put the brakes on the aggression.

- The author is enthusiastic about Dan's advice on mixing up your play to confuse opponents, but Erik and Dan caution that this can backfire if you aren't experienced enough to know when to dial it back.

- Fundamentally sound play is key early on. As you gain experience, you can add aggression more selectively.

- Dan stresses the importance of enduring losses and setbacks in order to objectively evaluate your abilities and thought processes. Success alone won't teach you how to play well.

- Having the courage to take risks is not enough - you need balance and the ability to pull back and reevaluate when things go wrong. The game will "take your money" if you don't understand what's happening.

- The goal should be to run the best operation you can, not fame or action. An objective view is crucial for a professional gambler.

In summary, balanced, selectively aggressive play based on a foundation of solid fundamentals, along with enduring failures to test your thought processes, is key to long-term poker success.

 Here are the key points:

- Dan Harrington emphasizes developing critical thinking and self-assessment skills to constantly reevaluate your poker game objectively. It's about the process, not winning or losing. 

- Dan quit poker after a big win because he realized he was getting weaker and the field was getting stronger. Quitting at the top illustrates his point about objectivity.

- Losing can teach you to be more objective about your play. Winning leads to overconfidence and illusion of control.

- Erik Seidel nearly lost everything after the 1987 stock market crash. But he stayed objective, reevaluated his options, and focused on improving. This helped him emerge successful.

- In poker, losses tend to punish delusion while wins feed the ego. You must learn to treat triumph and disaster as impostors.

- Ellen Langer's coin toss study shows we fall prey to the illusion of control when wins come early. Losing first aids objectivity.

- Erik demonstrates openness to feedback in updating his nutrition views based on new evidence. This objective mindset serves him well.

The key is maintaining objectivity, especially in the face of wins and losses. Poker teaches this well as delusion is often punished. Processing defeats constructively is essential.

 

- The author develops a routine of practicing online poker in New Jersey since it is illegal in New York. He does not believe in the 10,000 hour rule for mastery but acknowledges extensive practice is necessary to improve at poker.

- His mentor Erik approaches teaching poker through questioning and exploring different perspectives, rather than giving direct advice. He emphasizes making good decisions over specific strategies. This reminds the author of Virgil guiding Dante through hell, letting him find his own way rather than giving directions. 

- The author finds Erik's indirect approach frustrating at first but comes to appreciate the value of developing critical thinking skills over blindly following prescriptive advice. Thinking for oneself is key.

- The author learns that online poker was banned in the U.S. through vague legislation called UIGEA in 2006. Definitions of illegal gambling versus skill games were unclear. This illustrated to him the importance of clear decision making unclouded by political influences.

- Overall, the key ideas are the importance of extensive practice, critical strategic thinking over rote advice, and making decisions based on logic rather than external pressures or agendas. The author sees poker strategy as an illuminating window into decision making in wider life.

 

- The author was able to play online poker in New Jersey because the state has legalized it, unlike New York. This allowed the author to play while sitting in a coffee shop in New Jersey and look out at Manhattan, where it would be illegal. 

- The author chose the screenname "thepsychchic" to convey psychology/psychic, feminine, and chic attributes that could potentially influence opponents. 

- The author made multiple strategic mistakes early on by playing too aggressively with a weak hand due to inexperience and wanting to appear strong. 

- Her coach Erik pointed out she needs valid strategic reasons for every action, not just general ideas like wanting to win chips. She has to think through everything she knows about the hand and opponents.

- Making quick decisions under the pressure of the timer is a common mistake. Erik advises taking a breath, slowing down, and systematically considering all options - fold, call, raise - even with the timer.

- The author recognizes that avoiding mindless, impulsive decisions and having a thoughtful process is key, though it's made difficult by the time pressure element. But practice and training can help overcome this common pitfall.

 

- As a poker beginner, the author has no established habits or reflexive actions yet - this allows him to thoughtfully consider all options instead of relying on potentially faulty "muscle memory."

- The author draws an analogy between poker strategy and military strategy/tactics. Each action must be carefully planned based on the specific "terrain" and opponents. You can't just do what worked before.

- With multiple opponents, you have to simplify your strategy as there are too many variables. But you still need to think ahead to future possible scenarios. 

- Without experience observing opponents, you lack key intel on their tendencies and can't tailor your approach. You have to study their patterns over time.

- The "terrain" of the cards on the board greatly impacts strategy. You have to adjust your approach based on whether it's a wet board, dry board, static, or dynamic.

- Bet sizing is critical and must match your precise strategic goal. Over- or under-betting is problematic.

- As a beginner, the author lacks the experience and observation time needed to perfectly tailor strategy and sizing to the situation and opponents. But the key is recognizing what he still needs to learn.

 

- Erik is an expert poker player known for his ability to observe opponents and predict their behavior, like a "dragonfly" predator. 

- In a televised heads-up poker match, Erik makes a huge call against his aggressive opponent Dzmitry Urbanovich with just jack-high, correctly predicting Urbanovich was bluffing with nothing. 

- Erik had observed Urbanovich's aggressive style and predicted he would make a bluff in this spot based on the action, despite having a very weak hand himself. 

- Erik scratches his chin, sighs, bites his lip, and takes several minutes before calling, adding to the drama and likely inducing Urbanovich to follow through with his bluff.

- Erik's ability to closely observe opponents, predict their patterns of behavior, and make moves based on those reads is a major strength, allowing him to make excellent calls and folds.

- This hand exemplifies Erik's patient, calculated style, using observation of opponents instead of just his own cards to guide decisions. His skills allow him to succeed even when card strength is lacking.

 

- Maria begins playing in a 16-dollar online poker tournament. She finds herself at a table with a very aggressive player she has labeled "AIA" (Aggressive Idiot Asshole) based on past experience. 

- She is determined to get her first victory against this aggressive opponent. She adopts a "war mentality", being patient and gathering information before making her move. 

- On the first hand she is dealt queen-nine offsuit. The AIA raises pre-flop. Maria calls, planning to fold if she doesn't improve. The flop comes queen-queen-three, giving her top set. 

- The AIA bets big. Maria knows he often bets big with both strong hands and bluffs. She calls, gathering more information and setting up her trap. 

- The turn pairs the three. The AIA shoves all-in. Maria tank-calls, taking time to put him on a likely hand. She deduces he is bluffing, perhaps with an ace-king type hand. 

- Maria calls and shows her queens. The AIA has ace-king and does not improve. Maria wins the massive pot, knocking him out of the tournament shortly after. She has gained confidence from her first big victory.

 

- The passage describes the author's experience attending their first live poker tournament, which they were unexpectedly entered into by their poker coach Erik. 

- The tournament brings together celebrities, poker stars, and amateur players. The author feels out of place as a novice.

- Erik encourages the author to play, saying it will be good experience compared to playing robots online. The author protests feeling unprepared. 

- Erik mentions his daughter Jamie also plays poker and recently won a tournament, showing poker runs in their family. His mom was also once a big winner in a poker game.

- The author feels intimidated and unqualified compared to Erik's successful family members. They worry about making mistakes and embarrassing themselves as a novice at their first live tournament. 

- Ultimately the author decides to embrace the experience and learn from it, seeing it as an opportunity to learn by playing with experienced pros. They realize beginners have to start somewhere.

In summary, the passage depicts the author's self-doubt and intimidation at their unexpected entry into a high-profile live poker tournament as a total beginner, before coming to accept the challenge.

 

- Erik encourages the author to play more aggressively in poker, saying it will help her improve faster even though there is more variance. The author struggles with aggression as it doesn't come naturally. 

- Erik suggests her being female and unknown may actually help her get away with aggressive plays, as opponents may be more likely to fold against her. 

- The author realizes her passivity stems in part from social conditioning - aggression in women is often seen negatively, whereas in men it is valued. She gives the example of a job offer being rescinded from a woman who negotiated assertively. 

- Research shows women are penalized for being assertive in ways men are not. Women leaders are also judged more harshly for displaying authority compared to male peers.

- The author sees this dynamic play out at the charity poker event, noticing most players are men despite many women in attendance. She resolves to challenge herself to be more aggressive in poker and in life.

 

The author realizes that despite her training in psychology and professional success, she has internalized gender biases that make her play poker in an overly passive, feminine way. Her coach Erik tries to push her to be more aggressive, recognizing this tendency before she does. Though initially uncomfortable with it, the author acknowledges she needs to overcome these ingrained biases if she wants to succeed at the male-dominated poker tables. She sees how her reasoning is affected, falling prey to biases like the "hot hand fallacy" and overconfidence after a lucky win. The author comes to understand that knowledge of biases is not enough - she has to actively fight them in practice, in the high-pressure live poker environment, if she wants to thrive as a player. Overall, it's a journey of self-discovery for the author as a female poker player, realizing she is not a "blank slate" but shaped by socialization, which she must now work to move past.

 

- The author discusses cognitive biases like the hot hand fallacy, where people think they are "on a streak" and likely to continue winning, and the gambler's fallacy, where people think they are "due" for a win after a string of losses. These biases cause people to make faulty judgments about probability and randomness. 

- Games often accommodate these biases by skewing randomness to match people's intuitions, rather than true probability. But the author argues games like poker are better because they force you to confront reality and your misperceptions. 

- People tend to have an internal locus of control, thinking their actions affect outcomes more than they do. This is usually advantageous but can lead to unrealistic views of influence over randomness.

- The author exhibits these biases playing poker, thinking she is "due" for cards to go her way. She makes poor decisions trying to push back when challenged, rather than folding or being more aggressive. 

- She busts out of a charity tournament by calling with a weak hand, swayed by other players goading her. She is angry at herself for not playing to her knowledge and letting insecurity guide her actions.

 Here's a summary of the key points:

- The author played poorly in her first live poker tournament, failing to apply the skills and strategies she had practiced. She was overwhelmed as a novice playing live against real opponents. 

- High emotion can impair memory and clear thinking. Novices experience more emotion, while experts are more comfortable and play on "autopilot." Both stages have downsides - novices are overwhelmed, experts can get overconfident.

- The author considered giving up after one bad night, but realized it was too soon to jump to conclusions. She vows to keep trying and improve. 

- The contrast between Vegas' lush casinos and the surrounding desert shows how the city defies nature and reason. It grew from a struggling desert town to an oasis enabled by the Hoover Dam, casino developers like Bugsy Siegel, Howard Hughes' investments, and more.

In short, the author struggled as a poker novice in live play due to emotion and inexperience, but decides not to give up prematurely. Meanwhile, Vegas' unlikely existence and growth symbolizes beating the odds.

 

- The author initially hates Vegas, finding it disorienting and overly artificial upon arrival at the airport. She thinks casinos are designed to deplete decision-making abilities. 

- She goes with Erik to watch Penn Jillette's eccentric house be destroyed by a tank, seeing it as an example of how fantasy and reality blend seamlessly in Vegas. 

- The author plans to play poker daily to prepare for the WSOP in 6 months. Erik advises starting at lower buy-in tournaments to build her bankroll, as she's not ready for the top tournaments yet despite her online experience. 

- Erik explains poker economics like staking, backing, and swapping action. Even many pros go broke from mismanaging bankrolls and variance. It's vital but unsexy to budget properly.

- The author realizes she has more to learn about bankroll management and mental preparedness. She decides she needs to treat her Vegas trip as a focused training experience, not a fantasy party. She commits to learning from Erik.

 

- The author is playing in her first poker tournament in Las Vegas, a $50 event at the Golden Nugget. She is accompanied by her poker mentor, Erik. 

- Erik has advised her to start small, playing in cheaper tournaments off the Strip first to gain experience, rather than jumping right into the World Series of Poker Main Event. He suggests the Ladies Event could be a good stepping stone. 

- The author bristles at the idea of playing the Ladies Event, wanting to be seen as a good poker player, not a good female poker player. She is determined to stick with poker and become a strong player capable of competing in the Main Event.

- At the Golden Nugget, she observes a predator-like character she nicknames "The Fox" who also enters the tournament. Despite being nervous and inexperienced, she is excited to play in her first real tournament.

- She makes a mental note to practice chip tricks and is strategic about her seat selection. As play begins, she is focused and determined to learn as much as she can from this initial experience.

 

The author describes playing in a poker tournament at an old casino in Las Vegas. A player pretending to be a novice joins the table and uses sneaky tactics to take advantage of the other players. The author realizes this player is an "angle shooter" manipulating the perception of being new to gain an edge. 

The author plays in more tournaments but continues to lose. At one tournament, the author makes it to the final four players but is eliminated after getting her pocket nines cracked by a flush draw. She excitedly recounts this bad beat to her partner Erik, who stops her and says not to dwell on bad beats. Erik explains focusing on whether you played correctly rather than fixating on luck is the proper mindset. 

The author reflects on how framing things as a victim of bad luck versus victor of correct decisions profoundly impacts learning and growth. In poker, bad beat talk is harmless but in life it can spiral into a self-fulfilling prophecy of failure. She resolves to think of herself as a decision-maker in control rather than passive victim of circumstance.

 

- The passage describes a high stakes poker game with many of the world's top players in attendance, including famous pros like Doug Polk, Daniel Negreanu, and Ike Haxton. 

- The players come from diverse backgrounds - some from wealthy families and elite universities, others from poverty and difficult childhoods. Poker allows people from all walks of life to compete on a relatively even playing field if they have the skill. 

- The author notes that poker comes closer to a true meritocracy than most other endeavors, as anyone can play if they have the buy-in and the skill, regardless of background. Factors like education, connections, and demographics matter less. 

- However, it's not a perfect meritocracy, as factors like a stable upbringing, freedom to learn the game, and early luck in variance still play a role in success. But it's as close to a meritocracy as the author has seen.

- The passage conveys the range of personalities at the table, from more reserved players to animated ones, showing how poker attracts all types. Ultimately, their diverse backgrounds are outweighed by the skill that earned them a seat at the table.

 

- The author attends a high stakes poker game with top professional players like Erik Seidel and Andrew "Chewy" Lichtenberger to gain insights into their strategies. However, she finds the level of play overwhelming and questions whether she can ever reach such heights. 

- She compares Erik's subtle, adaptable style to a jazz bassist holding everything together. His nickname "The Silent Assassin" captures his stealthy approach. 

- Chewy exemplifies intense focus, barely looking up from the table or his cards. His calm demeanor hides the strength of his hands. The author aims to learn from his powers of observation.

- Many top players surprisingly spend poker games distracted on their phones rather than closely studying their opponents. 

- Chewy folds a strong hand against an amateur player whose pattern of calling and raising indicates exceptional cards. Another pro keeps betting based on a statistical strategy, ignoring behavioral tells, and loses big. 

- The author is awed by the game's complexity but resolves to pay close attention, absorb as much as she can, and keep aiming to improve her play. Erik and Chewy model the critical poker skills of focus, observation, and adaptability.

 

- Edward is a strong poker player who relies heavily on game theory and simulations to determine the mathematically optimal play for each hand. However, this over-reliance on math can give a false sense of certainty and lead to mistakes when he fails to incorporate new information from opponents' behavior at the table. 

- In contrast, Chewy exemplifies intense focus and being fully present in each moment. Rather than following a preset plan, he reacts and adapts to the flow of the game. His practices like yoga, tai chi, and kung fu cultivate this mindset. 

- Attention and observation are critical. Just having a mathematically prepared mind is not enough - you need to closely observe the game as it unfolds. As Pasteur said, "Chance favors only the prepared mind."

- By maximizing focus and presence, you minimize the windows where bad beats and variance can affect you - you observe the signals to change your play rather than getting locked into a preset strategy. 

- Luck comes from being alert and ready to capitalize when chance appears. You can't control variance but you can control your attention. Chewy exemplifies utilizing all available information while still remaining adaptable.

 

- Maria Konnikova meets poker player Phil Galfond for dinner in Las Vegas. She had expected him to be a flashy, tattooed bro based on knowing he once had a slide installed between two apartments he owned. 

- Instead, Galfond is mild-mannered and affable. He looks more like someone who would work at a tech startup than frequent nightclubs. 

- Over dinner, Konnikova learns that Galfond is one of the best poker players in the world and owns a poker training site called Run It Once. He is expanding the business with new ventures. 

- Galfond offers to help Konnikova with her poker journey despite his busy schedule, showcasing his passion for the game. This surprises Konnikova, who had thought poker players would be more selfish. 

- Galfond and Erik Seidel share a love of poker and a desire to grow the game. Konnikova is starting to realize this kind of selfless passion is not as rare among top poker players as she had assumed.

 

- Phil Hellmuth suggests two ways to learn poker - through rote memorization of strategy, or through developing critical thinking skills to understand motivations and narratives. He encourages the latter approach. 

- Phil says poker is about being a detective and storyteller - figuring out your opponent's motivations and whether their actions make sense based on the story they are trying to tell. You must also ensure your own actions and narrative are coherent. 

- Always ask "why" about your opponents' actions as well as your own. There is a reason behind everything, even from bad players. Don't judge, just understand the motivation.

- Phil advises balancing studying with playing to avoid an "illusion of knowledge." Experience is needed to supplement descriptions and book knowledge.

- The passage ends with the narrator committing to play diligently in the coming weeks, taking notes and talking through hands, embracing the mindset of being a detective/storyteller/explorer. The key is to develop critical thinking skills rather than just memorizing strategy.

 

- The author plays in a morning poker tournament at Planet Hollywood and implements lessons learned from her poker mentor, focusing and trying not to panic. She makes it to the final table as the chip leader.

- The male players try to convince her to chop the prize money rather than play it out. She refuses multiple times, wanting to prove herself as a player. 

- She wins the tournament, her first live victory, earning over $900. She is excited to be an official winner tracked by the Hendon Mob poker database. 

- With her mentor's approval, she now plays in tournaments at the prestigious Aria casino. She gets her first cash there, earning over $2,000 and giving her a poker bankroll.

- The author reflects on needing many small successes to build up to high stakes games. Her wins are a start, giving her confidence and money to enter bigger tournaments on the path to the World Series of Poker.

 

- The author is on a helicopter from Nice to Monte Carlo to play in a big poker tournament. She feels like James Bond but is also terrified of crashing. 

- The helicopter was grounded due to weather but takes off again briefly. The author survives the flight and lands in Monte Carlo, where she visits the famous casino. 

- The author imagines the scene in 1936 when mathematician Claude Shannon first conceived of using math to beat roulette while gambling at that casino. 

- Shannon met a woman named Klari at the roulette table, who was intrigued by his pages of figures. They began talking about using mathematics to gain an edge.

- Shannon came up with a primitive wearable computer to predict roulette results. He won over $20,000 before the casino directors banned him. 

- This interaction sparked Shannon's pioneering work establishing the mathematical theory of information and laying the foundations of the digital revolution.

- The author feels she is following in Shannon's footsteps, trying to use math and science to excel at poker in Monte Carlo. She is eager to test herself against top competition in the tournament.

 Here are the key points:

- The narrator arrives at the European Poker Tour in Monte Carlo, where John von Neumann first developed his mathematical system to beat roulette. She hopes to make progress in her goal of cracking poker's code, standing where von Neumann had his eureka moment.

- In the high stakes area, she observes a prop bet between comedian Kevin Hart and poker pro Dan Colman - Hart bets Colman can't do 105 pushups in under 22 minutes. Colman succeeds and wins the bet. 

- Prop bets are ubiquitous in poker, though the old masters like Titanic Thompson used them more as scams with asymmetric information. Modern prop bettors are more interested in testing the limits of their own control. 

- The prop bet represents one side of the nerd vs cowboy dynamic - the mathematician trying to control chance vs the gambler pushing his limits. Both are attempts to combat chance.

 

Maria attends her first big poker tournament in Monte Carlo. She makes it to day two and cashes for a small profit, though she goes out earlier than hoped. Her mentor Erik celebrates her success with her and tells stories of his early days playing backgammon there decades ago. They have dinner at Erik's favorite local restaurant and run into some of his old backgammon friends. Maria learns about the legend of Falafel and the degenerate prop betting that goes on in the gambling world. She also hears about a game called Lodden Thinks, where players bet on what their friend Lodden will guess the answer to random questions is. Though Maria enjoys her experience, she decides not to get sucked into the gambling lifestyle, which Erik warns her against "degenning." The tournament concludes but the ultimate victor remains unknown.

 Based on the story, it seems Phil Ivey would win the round of Lodden Thinks against Doyle Brunson. 

The key points:

- The game was between Phil Ivey and Doyle Brunson, with Daniel Negreanu as the "Lodden" who had to guess Clint Eastwood's age. 

- Ivey and Brunson went back and forth increasing their guesses, with Ivey ending up at 73 and Brunson at 74. 

- When Negreanu revealed his guess was 73, Ivey won the $10,000 bet against Brunson. 

- Even though Brunson knew the correct answer was 77, Ivey won by better determining what Negreanu would guess. 

So despite not knowing the factual answer, Ivey succeeded in putting himself in Negreanu's shoes and won that round of Lodden Thinks against Brunson. The ability to understand the other player's perspective was more important than objective facts.

 It sounds like you learned some important lessons in Monte Carlo about adjusting your tournament strategy and being willing to take more risks to accumulate chips and finish higher, rather than just focusing on min-cashing. Erik gave you helpful feedback about identifying flaws in your play and setting ambitious goals, which can feel discouraging at first but is necessary for continued growth. 

The story highlights how easy it is to make assumptions about opponents based on appearance, like the aggressive tank-top guy, but that tells come from observing actual play, not stereotyping. Overall, it's a thoughtful reflection on challenging complacency, aiming higher, and the steep learning curve in poker and in life of always finding new flaws to address once you reach a new level. The advice to focus on observable behavior rather than making assumptions is wise, both at the poker table and away from it.

 

- I stereotyped a player with tattoos and a shaved head as an aggressive "maniac" based on thin-slice judgments and implicit biases rather than actual evidence about his playing style. This caused me to make poor decisions when playing against him. 

- I relied too much on superficial cues like appearance and demographic characteristics instead of gathering real information through observing his gameplay over time. This led me to impute motives and styles of play to him that were inaccurate.

- Our brains quickly form first impressions of people, often based on facial features, expressions, and our own past experiences/biases. But these snap judgments are often mistaken when evaluating individuals. 

- I need to be more aware of my implicit biases and tendency to stereotype. I should gather actual evidence and be cautious about acting on first impressions at the poker table. Players come from diverse backgrounds; what "seems" true based on appearance isn't necessarily accurate.

- Overconfidence in my reads and judgments of other players has been a persistent flaw. I need more humility about my ability to understand people quickly, especially at higher stakes with unfamiliar opponents. Adjusting to the human element may be the hardest part of improving at poker.

 

- We often make snap judgments and first impressions about people, believing we can accurately read them. However, research shows we are frequently wrong. 

- In studies, people denied the real reasons for their judgments when presented with evidence, instead insisting they had objective rationale. We have an inflated sense of our person perception skills.

- To accurately read people takes vast expertise - hundreds of hours of observation across many interactions. Our quick first impressions are often faulty.

- However, some research has uncovered useful information from studying expert poker players over time. Certain observable behaviors and motions can reveal valuable insights. 

- The author aims to leverage psychological research to improve her ability to read opponents in poker. She hopes to pick up enough scientifically-based tells to compensate for her lack of technical skill compared to veteran players.

In summary, while our intuitive reads of people are often wrong, aggregating many observations over time, as expert poker players do, can uncover useful behavioral tells. The author seeks to apply this psychological research to improve her poker strategy.

 

- In a series of studies, students were better than chance at judging the strength of a poker hand when watching clips of just the players' hands, but not their faces. Hand motions seemed to convey useful information about hand strength.

- The author decides to focus on reading opponents' hand motions rather than faces to try to improve his reads in live play. 

- He meets with Blake Eastman, a psychologist and poker player who has conducted a large study on poker tells. 

- Eastman explains that tells are complex and you need to look for patterns, not just one gesture. Face reading is not very useful but hand motions can convey useful information.

- Eastman's research finds factors like betting speed, betting smoothness, and grip changes correlate with hand strength. 

- The author realizes he may be giving off tells with his own hand motions that he's unaware of and needs to control. 

- In summary, the author plans to focus on hand motions rather than faces to improve his ability to read opponents in the upcoming WSOP, while also controlling his own motions to avoid giving off tells.

 

- Blake, a poker expert, analyzes poker players' body language and gestures to identify patterns and tells. Subtle behaviors like chip handling and betting motions can reveal information about a player's thought process and hand strength. 

- The most honest player behaviors often come right after checking hole cards, before concealment efforts ramp up. How players check their cards and react initially tends to reveal their emotions transparently.

- Blake analyzed the author's gameplay and identified several potentially revealing behaviors, like rechecking hole cards, handling cards in certain ways, being overly consistent early on, and talking/engaging too much. 

- He advised the author to standardize her thought process before each action to act more confidently and avoid reacting immediately. This makes behaviors more natural and less likely to convey specific information.

- The author plans to practice these concealment tactics before playing in major summer poker tournaments, though she struggles somewhat with controlling her natural conversational inclinations.

 

- The author discusses Walter Mischel's CAPS (cognitive-affective personality system) model for analyzing behavior, which argues that personality traits depend heavily on context and dynamics rather than just a set of scores. 

- The author realizes CAPS aligns with his goal of predicting poker player behavior in various situations. Poker provides many diagnostic situations to observe reactions and build an if-then profile of a player. 

- The author gives examples of how he reacts differently to risk in various contexts, illustrating the importance of situation. Psychological tells based on reactions rather than physical patterns can reveal these dynamics.

- Players go through phases that alter their decision making.Identifying when a player becomes gun-shy or tilt-prone after wins/losses provides insights into their profile. 

- The author's own personality and experiences emerge through the situations faced at the poker table over time.

- The dynamics between players can shift the psychological situation and alter behaviors, as part of an iterative adjustment process. This makes tells complex but understanding player profiles powerful.

 

- The author returned from the poker tournament in Monte Carlo feeling reasonably satisfied with her semi-triumphant performance, though she had missed her target. She vowed to work on reading others and preventing them from reading her tells. 

- However, May didn't go as planned. Though she and Erik scouted local tournaments, once back in Brooklyn she realized she didn't want to leave again. After months of nonstop travel and poker, she had gotten lonely on the road and forgotten why she came to poker in the first place. 

- She spent time reconnecting with her husband and friends in New York, realizing how much she had neglected her real life. She also recognized that she hadn't made time for activities like yoga that keep her balanced. 

- With the World Series of Poker Main Event looming, she felt conflicted about diving back into the poker world full time. She wondered if she could reach her goals without fully immersing herself again. 

- She decided to return to Vegas in June as planned, but resolved to find more balance. She would play poker seriously but also make time for yoga, friends, and other activities unrelated to poker. The author recognized the need to integrate poker into her larger life rather than making it her whole world.

 

- Maria headed to her first World Series of Poker event in Las Vegas, the Colossus tournament. She was excited but also nervous for her first WSOP experience. 

- Upon arriving at the Rio casino, Maria got lost trying to find the WSOP area. She eventually found her way there and was overwhelmed by the crowds and bazaar-like atmosphere, with booths aggressively selling merchandise. 

- Maria registered for the Colossus tournament. Despite only planning to play one entry, she ended up registering 5 separate times after repeatedly busting out and re-entering. This cost her $2,825 total, blowing a big chunk of her planned budget. 

- Maria was disappointed in herself for losing discipline and re-entering so many times, against the advice of her mentor Erik. She left the Rio confused about what happened and questioning her bankroll management.

- The Colossus allows multiple re-entries across multiple starting flights over several days. This tempted Maria to keep re-entering after busting out, hoping for a better result.

 

- The author returned to her hotel after busting out of some WSOP events, feeling disappointed in her performance. Despite preparing extensively, she got caught up in the excitement and wasn't as focused as she should have been. 

- She reflects on how the pros can handle the emotional ups and downs of tournaments, whereas she feels exhausted after just two weeks. While she earned some cashes, she lost money overall. 

- The author debates whether she should play the Main Event this year as originally planned, or wait until she has more experience. She concludes it would be smarter to start smaller, build her skills, and return next year better prepared. 

- She realizes she shouldn't play just for the sake of playing or writing about it. The journey has taught her to seek situations where she has an edge, not jump into something over her head. 

- The author acknowledges she should have known this going in, but got caught up in the excitement. She questions why she ignored what she knew to be the wiser decision.

 

- The author had an ambitious goal of learning poker from scratch and aiming for the World Series of Poker (WSOP) Main Event in just one year. 

- However, they realized they were being overly optimistic with the timeline due to planning fallacy and status quo bias. The author failed to adjust their goals even after new information suggested the original timeline was unrealistic. 

- The author exhibited sunk cost fallacy, being unwilling to change course after already investing significant time and resources into the initial goal. 

- Despite data showing the author was losing money in poker, they exhibited irrational overconfidence and Dunning-Kruger effect, overestimating their poker skills after some small successes. 

- The author actively avoided seeking advice that could dissuade them from their original timeline, wanting to stick to their predetermined preferences.

- The author demonstrated several decision-making biases rather than exercising flexibility, critical thinking, and objective reassessment in response to new information.

 * I entered the Main Event despite advice not to, due to ego and wanting praise
* I was playing through a migraine on day 1 and struggled, barely surviving to day 2
* On day 2 I got impatient, focused on the average stack instead of my own stack, and made a poor all-in move with top pair weak kicker
* I busted out earlier than I should have due to playing impatiently and not following the advice I had been given
* The experience taught me the importance of being honest with myself and my coach, playing my best game, ignoring what others are doing, and sticking to the strategy we had developed

 

- The author busted out of the Main Event after making an emotional decision to call with only top pair against an opponent who seemed very strong. She knew it was the wrong move but couldn't access her rational thinking in the moment. 

- This made the author realize she needed help working on her mental game. She reached out to mental coach Jared Tendler.

- Tendler said poker brings out and exaggerates our existing fears and flaws. His goal is to identify and address the root causes so players can avoid emotional mistakes at the table. 

- He told the author to stop "hoping" and start actively preparing and doing. Hoping leads to poor decisions.

- Tendler explained tilt - letting emotions affect decision making. Tilt isn't just anger, it can be any emotion not related to the decision at hand.

- The key is being able to recognize tilt and avoid letting emotions interfere with rational thinking during play. This is what the author aims to work on with Tendler's help.

 Here are a few key points I took away from the passage:

- Damage to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) can impair emotional decision-making, causing people to make risky choices while gambling. 

- Incidental emotions (like moods caused by the weather) can influence decisions, but making people aware of the source of the emotion can eliminate this effect. This supports the idea that emotions contain information relevant to decision-making.

- However, very strong emotions may still influence decisions even if one is aware of them. It's important to anticipate how an outcome may make you feel and avoid situations that will trigger detrimental emotions. 

- Tilt causes you to revert to your worst game. It's important to map out your emotional triggers and thought processes during tilt, so you can insert rational thinking in the moment. The goal is to move your bell curve toward your best game over time.

- Some key tilt triggers identified were sexist comments from male players and a feeling of injustice when opponent's poor play results in winning hands (e.g. calling incorrectly but hitting cards). Logic statements need to be prepared to counteract these emotional reactions.

 

- The author describes various disturbing encounters with male players while playing poker, including sexual propositions, condescending remarks, and unwanted advice. These incidents leave her feeling upset and powerless. 

- To regain a sense of control, she starts wearing noise-canceling headphones at the table. This allows her to tune out unwanted comments while still hearing game-relevant information. 

- She works with a mental coach to address deeper emotional issues affecting her game - impostor syndrome, anxiety about disappointing others, lack of confidence to make aggressive moves. 

- Through visualization, embodied cognition, and other techniques, she learns to project more confidence and push past her fears.

- She realizes the need to strike a balance - staying sharp by playing regularly but also recharging emotionally in New York. Too much time at the tables breeds instability. 

- The mental work helps her improve her poker strategy and emotional resilience. She retrenches to smaller tournaments while rebuilding her game.

 

- After six difficult months, the author started to feel more optimistic about poker. Her skills and mindset were improving. 

- She became more comfortable in the poker world, making connections and getting media coverage. She won some smaller tournaments and cashed in bigger ones like the EPT.

- Her confidence grew as she started looking forward to events instead of dreading them. She was proud of her progress and had better emotional control. 

- At the prestigious PCA event in the Bahamas, the author made her first major final table despite exhaustion and lack of sleep. 

- Top players offered her various pills and drugs to help her sleep and perform. This showed their dedication to optimizing performance with pharmaceuticals.

- The author realized she still had more to learn about the lengths players go to gain an edge. But she was proud of her progress over the past year. Her skills and confidence had increased significantly.

 

- Professional poker players take a very analytical, game theory approach to optimizing their performance. They carefully calculate the costs and benefits of various routines and habits.

- Ike Haxton starts his day with a caffeine pill rather than coffee for efficiency reasons. Other players have specialized diets, meditation practices, and exercise regimens. 

- The author feels out of her depth at the final table, intimidated by the accomplishments of the other players. She tries to remember that they all had lucky breaks and have weaknesses like anyone else. 

- Erik unexpectedly shows up to support the author. His advice is simply "Don't be a fish."

- Early on, the author mistakenly plays pocket aces too aggressively against a strong opponent, losing a third of her stack. She recognizes she made a mistake against the relentless logic of the other players.

 Thank you for sharing this story. It sounds like a challenging situation, but you handled it thoughtfully. Staying calm, taking breaks, and resetting mentally are wise strategies. Trusting your expertise and carefully evaluating each decision is impressive. Win or lose, you can be proud of the mental discipline and maturity you displayed. Keep focusing on improving - one hand, one session, one step at a time. The skills you're building will serve you well, both at the poker table and in life.

 

- Maria was the shortest stack at the final table of a major poker tournament with 5 players left. She got lucky and doubled up with pocket sevens against the chip leader's pocket aces to stay alive. 

- It got down to 3 players - Maria, an older aggressive player, and the chip leader Grandmaster. Maria doubled up against the older player with ace-king vs his ace-deuce to knock him out in 3rd place. 

- Now heads-up against the Grandmaster for the title, Maria feels pumped and focused. Heads-up play is different than a full table - it requires quick action and confidence. 

- Maria has been practicing heads-up play for the past 2 months to improve her skills after losing heads-up in a previous tournament. 

- Before play resumes heads-up, Maria texts Erik who encourages her to play it out as she's been practicing. Erik and his wife Ruah are on their way to the casino to cheer Maria on.

 

- Maria won a major poker tournament on her one-year anniversary of learning to play poker. This validated her hard work and skill development over the past year. 

- Her victory generated excitement and media attention. She received sponsorship from PokerStars to join their team of professional players. This provided more opportunities to play and travel.

- Despite her success, Maria still felt unsure if she was actually skilled or just got lucky. She wanted to prove she could win consistently before fully embracing the title of pro. 

- Maria decided to continue playing poker full-time for another year, seeing it as a chance to test her abilities on a bigger stage. She hoped to show her victory wasn't just a fluke and that skill triumphed over luck in the long run.

- The passage transitions to Maria talking with Kevin Slavin, who founded a gaming company. He explains how selling his company unexpectedly led him to move to Beirut, seeking more uncertainty and randomness in his life after years of hard work and control.

 Here are the key points:

- The author unexpectedly came into a couple million dollars from the success of a company he started. He felt conflicted and undeserving of this "windfall", and tried to redistribute some of it to causes he cared about. 

- In a hotel in Beirut, he became obsessed with playing a simple grid-based game that involved elements of luck, as a way to process and understand his feelings about having gotten so lucky financially. This experience made him think more philosophically about the role of luck vs skill in life outcomes.

- He traveled to Macau, the epicenter of gambling, to confront his fears about the role of pure chance. Macau is an alien, hyper-focused gambling world that makes visible the dark underbelly and human ugliness that comes with fully embracing luck and chance. 

- The author recoils at much of what he sees in Macau - the barely legal prostitutes, the Chinese businessmen finding loopholes to get cash to gamble - but came anyway to fully metabolize and understand the role of luck, even though it frightens him. Macau represents a confrontation with the beast of pure chance.

 

- In Macau, people embrace superstitions and lucky charms to try to influence the goddess of chance. Professional poker players like Ike Haxton even cultivate some superstitions intentionally. 

- Ike gives examples of his own lucky objects, like a shirt he wore when he won a tournament and a dollar bill he got in a memorable hand. He believes having these talismans provides a sense of control and confidence.

- I point out the potential downsides of relying on superstitions, like overconfidence or being thrown off mentally if a lucky charm is lost. Research shows the power of the mind to affect performance through the placebo and nocebo effects.  

- Belief can be powerful, but superstitions are false attributions that can undermine learning. The "black cat effect" refers to how one omen can disrupt mental equilibrium and cause poor play or decision making.

- While superstitions may provide an illusion of control, they ultimately introduce more uncertainty. By relying on outside factors, you lose true control and make your mental state vulnerable.

 

- The author discusses how some highly successful poker players engage in superstitious or magical thinking by using "lucky" objects or rituals. Examples include Johnny Chan's orange, Daniel Negreanu's ability to "know" the next card, and vision boards. 

- This magical thinking is surprising given these players' reliance on math and logic. The author suggests it may be a form of "acquiescence" - recognizing something is irrational but choosing to do it anyway. 

- Regular players are more understandable, but it's jarring to see top players fall prey to superstitions. The author posits it may relate to a quest for control over the uncontrollable. 

- The author's friend Erik is strongly averse to such magical thinking, seeing it as irrational. But the author suggests that even highly rational players may engage in it.

- Overall, the author finds the prevalence of superstitions in high-level poker interesting given the math and logic underlying the game. It seems tied to a universal human desire for control and meaning.

 

- The author is in Macau with Erik Seidel. Erik is dismissive of superstitions and lucky charms in poker, believing they cultivate the wrong mindset. 

- This reminds Erik of his late mentor Paul Magriel (known as X-22), one of the first people to teach Erik backgammon. Magriel was brilliant but had issues with drugs and gambling addictions that degraded his talents. 

- Magriel knew gambling was irrational but couldn't stop himself, showing the danger of giving in to one's weaknesses. Erik wishes more people knew Magriel in his prime, before the addictions took over.

- The author reflects on her brief meeting with Magriel in Las Vegas. He seemed lonely and was trying to hustle her. It was sad to see the once debonair Magriel in such diminished circumstances. 

- Magriel's downfall shows why the author has an instinctive dismissal of superstitions - they invite chaos and represent a loss of control, the opposite of poker's emphasis on logic and reason.

- However, the author reflects that confidence and belief can sometimes lead to improved performance, like with "hot hands" in basketball. Complete dismissal of belief may be going too far. Mindset affects performance, especially in creative endeavors.

 

After her success in Macau, Maria takes a break from poker. She returns to the World Series of Poker and this time cashes in the Main Event, a major accomplishment. Though she doesn't final table, she feels satisfied that she hasn't let Erik down. Later in the year, she notches her best ever finish at the European Poker Tour event in Barcelona. She continues playing well, making the final three tables at the WPT Borgata event. She ends 2018 ranked as one of the top female tournament players. 

In 2019, Maria goes through a downturn and loses money for the year. But she has the tools to understand variance and not panic. She appreciates the beauty in her travels - synagogues, nature, people. Though not a good poker year, her writing career takes off with her book The Biggest Bluff. Maria comes to understand poker success requires balance - one needs to step away sometimes. She learns to separate poker from her self-worth. Maria continues to study and improve her game, while pursuing other passions in life.

 

- The author's mother and husband have made major career changes, pivoting to new professions. The author credits her success in poker with inspiring their transitions. 

- The author's grandmother wishes she would stop playing poker and start teaching, but the author feels she still has more to learn from poker before she is ready to stop. 

- The author was invited to speak about poker and decision-making at the World Economic Forum in Davos, which made her grandmother proud. But the talk was focused on the author's poker experiences.

- The author is not sure when to stop playing poker - when she has learned enough or accomplished her mission. Life may decide for her when it's time.

- At the 2019 World Series of Poker, the author suddenly lost her hearing and vision. She was terrified she was having a stroke but her senses returned after some time. She got an emergency MRI.

- The author acknowledges life can throw unpredictable events that disrupt careful plans, but poker has given her skills to deal with uncertainty and chaos. 

- We cannot control life's noise and randomness, only our reactions. The author feels lucky to simply have the chance to play the game of life.
