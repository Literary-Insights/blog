- The book promises to provide natural strategies to boost testosterone. 
- Testosterone is the primary male sex hormone essential for health, muscle growth, and libido. 
- Most men have lower testosterone than optimal. Signs of low T include weight gain, low energy, reduced libido, and muscle loss.
- Testosterone is produced primarily in the testicles, with a small amount from the adrenal glands. 
- The brain detects the need for more testosterone and signals the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland releases hormones that tell the testicles to produce more testosterone. 
- Cholesterol is converted into testosterone by cells in the testicles called Leydig cells.
- There are different types of testosterone:

1. Free testosterone - Not bound to proteins, the most potent form. Usually less than 5% of total T.
2. SHBG-bound testosterone - Bound to a protein called SHBG, made in the liver. 40-50% of total T but unavailable to tissues. 
3. Albumin-bound testosterone - Bound to albumin protein, also made in the liver. Also largely unavailable to tissues but can be converted to free T.

- The strategies in the book aim to increase the percentage of free testosterone.

 Here is a summary of the role of cellular fluid volumes:

• Intracellular fluid (ICF) - Fluid within the cells. Essential for cell functioning and contains electrolytes like potassium. Makes up about 2/3 of total body water. 

• Extracellular fluid (ECF) - Fluid outside the cells. Provides environment for cells and transport of nutrients. Made up of plasma and interstitial fluid. About 1/3 of total body water.

• Plasma - Fluid component of blood that contains proteins, clotting factors, electrolytes, and hormones. Important for circulation and transport.

• Interstitial fluid - Fluid surrounding cells. Bathes cells and allows for exchange of nutrients and waste products. Contains protein and electrolytes.

• Proper balance of ICF and ECF is essential for cells and organ function. Imbalances can lead to edema or dehydration. 

• Electrolytes like sodium and potassium are essential for maintaining fluid balance and cell signaling. They are controlled by the kidneys, adrenal glands and pituitary.

• Albumin and other plasma proteins help maintain oncotic pressure, which keeps fluid from leaking from the blood vessels. 

• Hormones like antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and aldosterone help regulate fluid volume by increasing kidney water reabsorption.

• The lymphatic system drains excess interstitial fluid and returns it to the blood. Failure of lymph nodes/vessels can lead to lymphedema.

So in summary, cellular fluid volumes encompass the intracellular fluid, extracellular fluid (including plasma and interstitial fluid), electrolytes and the hormonal/protein factors that help regulate the volumes and distribution of these fluids. Proper regulation and balance are essential for health and cell/organ function.

 

•Testosterone helps attract the opposite sex through pheromones and makes you appear more confident and dominant. 

•Increasing testosterone can decrease the risk of Alzheimer's disease and slow its progression.

•Other benefits of higher testosterone include:

- A healthier heart 
- Development of 6-pack abs through decreased body fat and increased muscle 
- Improved sleep, focus and energy

• nine strategies to naturally increase testosterone:

1. Improve and increase sleep. Aim for 7-9 hours of high-quality sleep per night. Use tips like writing a to-do list, reading fiction, making the room dark, using ambient noise, and finding the right temperature.

2. Increase fat intake. Dietary fat does not make you fat and is essential for testosterone production. Eat more saturated fats from red meat, coconut oil, and butter. Limit polyunsaturated fats from vegetable oils.

3. Follow a clean diet. Limit sugar, excess carbohydrates and alcohol which can decrease testosterone. Eat more cholesterol, zinc and magnesium which aid testosterone production.

4. Use strategic supplements like zinc, magnesium, vitamin D, and ashwagandha. 

5. Do weight lifting, especially compound lifts like squats and bench presses. This stimulates testosterone release.

6. Do high-intensity interval cardio training. Short, intense cardio sessions increase testosterone more than long steady sessions.

7. Have more sex. Sexual activity increases testosterone levels.

8. Exposure to cold. Take cold showers or use an ice pack on the testicles, which can increase testosterone.

9. Intermittent fasting. Going without food for specific periods, e.g., 12-16 hours, can increase testosterone.

 

Focus on natural fats like saturated and unsaturated fats. Avoid trans fats. Natural fats are crucial for health and boosting testosterone. 

Eat a clean diet focused on whole foods like protein, healthy fats, low GI carbs, nuts, and vegetables. Avoid processed foods, sugar, and refined carbs. A clean diet will maximize testosterone and health.

Use the formula P+V+F or C to create testosterone-boosting meals. P is protein, V is vegetables, F is fat, and C is low GI carbs. Portion sizes should be about a palm of protein, two fists of veg, a fist of carbs, and a fist of fat.

Incorporate strategic cheat days, like once a week. This helps combat cravings but limits excess. Stay active on cheat days and limit alcohol.

Use supplements strategically, including:

- Vitamin D3: 6,000-8,000 IU daily, cycling four weeks on and off. It acts like a steroid hormone and boosts testosterone.

- Fish oil: 3-5 grams per day. It provides omega-3 fats that reduce inflammation, boost fat burning, and support testosterone.

- Zinc: 30 mg per day. Zinc is crucial for making testosterone, and healthy levels are needed.

- Magnesium: 400 mg per day. Magnesium helps boost testosterone, and most people are deficient. 

Supplements will only help if you also implement lifestyle changes. They are meant to aid the natural strategies, not replace them.

In summary, focus on eating natural whole foods, especially healthy fats, following the P+V+F formula. Stay active and lift weights. Use strategic cheat days and supplements. Combining these strategies will naturally triple your testosterone levels.

 

Fish oil supplements have been shown to increase the production of the luteinizing hormone, which signals the testicles to produce testosterone. The benefits of fish oil include improved skin, hair, nail health, and heart health. The recommended dose is four capsules per day, split into two servings. 

Natural, vitamin-rich butter from grass-fed cows is high in vitamins A and K, which can help boost testosterone production. The recommended dose is 5-10 grams per day. It can be cooked with eggs, added to coffee, or eaten plain.

Whey protein powder can indirectly boost testosterone by helping build muscle. The recommended dose is 35-50 grams mixed with milk during your workout. Multiple daily shakes are fine, but use water for shakes beyond the first to avoid excess calories from dairy.

Weight lifting, especially heavy compound lifts, and high-intensity interval training can stimulate testosterone production. Focusing on compound lifts, increasing time under tension, taking muscles to failure, and increasing weight over time are strategies to maximize testosterone. Limit workouts to 3 weight sessions and 1 HIIT session per week to avoid overtraining. 

High-intensity interval training, such as sprint intervals, can also boost testosterone. An example protocol is 20-second sprints followed by bodyweight exercises and rest periods, repeated for several intervals. Start with basic HIIT before progressing to sprint intervals. Limit HIIT to 1 session per week to avoid overtraining.

Having regular sex, especially morning sex, can increase testosterone levels. Testosterone peaks in the morning, so having sex at this time can boost levels. 

Cold exposure, such as ice baths, cold showers, and cryotherapy, may increase testosterone by triggering the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone, which stimulates testosterone production. Start with short cold exposure and build up duration as you adapt. Limit intense cold exposure to 2-3 times per week.

- Ice baths, cold showers, and ice packs can increase testosterone through cold exposure. Ice baths for 10 minutes, 1-2 times a week, easing into the cold temperature. Cold showers for 10 minutes, aiming for the coldest temperature. Ice packs on the neck for 30 minutes.

- Sleep 7-9 hours per night to optimize testosterone. Lack of sleep lowers testosterone.

- Eat a diet high in fat, moderate in protein, and low in carbs. Focus on saturated fats like red meat, eggs, and coconut oil. Limit sugar and processed carbs.

- Use supplements like zinc, magnesium, vitamin D, and fish oil which support testosterone.

- Do weight lifting focusing on compound lifts like squats, deadlifts, bench presses, rows, and overhead presses. Three times a week, with rest days in between. Use heavy weights and lower reps, around 3 to 6 reps per set.

- Do high-intensity interval training 1-2 times a week. Short bursts of intense exercise followed by recovery periods. This boosts testosterone.

- Have sex or masturbate regularly to increase testosterone. Sexual activity causes a short-term increase in testosterone.

- Fast for 24 hours once a week to reset hormones, increase growth hormone, and speed fat loss. Only drink water, coffee, tea, and BCAAs during the fast.

- Make small lifestyle changes to limit stress and cortisol, which counteracts testosterone. Things like meditation, limiting alcohol and caffeine, and avoiding sugar spikes and crashes.

The sample day provides an example of implementing many of these strategies daily to increase your testosterone naturally. Consistency is key. By following the majority of these recommendations, you can significantly boost your testosterone levels.
