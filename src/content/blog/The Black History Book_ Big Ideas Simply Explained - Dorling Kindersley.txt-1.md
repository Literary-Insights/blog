- Black history covers thousands of years from earliest human origins in Africa to the present day. It includes peoples across Africa, descendants of the transatlantic slave trade, and Africans who have migrated globally. 

- The earliest humans emerged over 200,000 years ago in Africa. Early Africans saw themselves as distinct ethnic groups rather than a homogeneous "Black" race.

- European traders enslaved Africans beginning in the 15th century, subjecting them to the brutal Middle Passage to the Americas and Caribbean to work under horrific conditions. 

- Enslaved Africans revolted against their captors, most successfully in Haiti where they overthrew French rule and established an independent nation in 1804. 

- Abolition movements grew in the 18th-19th centuries in Europe and America. The US Civil War ended in the abolition of slavery in 1865. 

- After emancipation, Black people in America faced continued inequality under Jim Crow laws, while some migrated to newly established Liberia to escape oppression.

 

- The earliest humans originated in Africa around 3 million years ago. Around 200,000 years ago, humans began migrating out of Africa, eventually settling in parts of Asia, Europe and other regions. 

- Some of the earliest human settlements formed around 12,000 years ago in regions with major rivers like the Nile Valley, Euphrates River valley, and Tigris River valley. These early communities transitioned to farming.

- Major African civilizations developed around 3500 BCE, including Bantu-speaking peoples in West Africa and the earliest Egyptian state. The Nubian kingdom in Sudan was also established around 3400 BCE. 

- Ancient Egypt flourished into one of the earliest and most dominant civilizations through the Old, Middle and New Kingdoms. However, Egypt was periodically conquered by other powers like the Nubian kingdom of Kush and later the Assyrians and Greeks.

- Other early civilizations included the kingdom of Kush in Sudan, and the Phoenician city of Carthage in North Africa, which grew into a wealthy trading power. However, both North Africa and Egypt fell under Roman control by 30 BCE.

 Here are the key points about humans migrating out of Africa:

- Homo sapiens first migrated out of Africa over 200,000 years ago based on a skull found in Greece. 

- There were likely multiple migrations out of Africa starting around 140,000 years ago, rather than just one major migration 70,000-50,000 years ago as previously thought.

- Droughts in Africa around 135,000 years ago may have pushed people to migrate northeast into Eurasia and toward coastal areas. 

- A major volcanic eruption around 75,000 years ago further reduced global temperatures and forced humans to establish wider social networks.

- The main expansion out of Africa was probably around 70,000 years ago, with H. sapiens reaching Australia by 60,000 years ago.

- Early settlers are believed to have crossed into the Americas from Northeast Asia via the land mass of Beringia around 15,000-12,000 years ago.

So in summary, the evidence now suggests H. sapiens migrated out of Africa in multiple waves starting over 200,000 years ago, rather than a single major migration event originally thought to have occurred 70,000-50,000 years ago. Environmental factors like droughts and volcanic eruptions may have facilitated these expansions.

 

- Ancient Egypt had three golden ages known as the Old, Middle, and New Kingdoms. 

- The Old Kingdom (2575-2130 BCE) was the Pyramid Age when kings built large pyramids. There were several great kings like Sneferu, Khufu, Djoser. 

- The Middle Kingdom (2040-1782 BCE) saw the development of towns, roads, irrigation systems. Kings continued building pyramids on a smaller scale.

- The New Kingdom (1570-1069 BCE) was the period of Egyptian imperialism when they expanded foreign conquests. Famous kings include Hatshepsut, Thutmose III, Akhenaten, Tutankhamun, and Ramesses II. 

- Between the kingdoms were unstable Intermediate Periods due to foreign invasions and internal power struggles. However, Egypt continued advancing in writing, art, math, cities, and monumental architecture.

- Pharaohs were revered as divine rulers who mediated between humans and the gods. Religion and the Nile River were central to Egyptian civilization for nearly 3,000 years.

 

- Menes united Upper and Lower Egypt around 3150 BCE, founding the city of Memphis as the capital. He established the early dynasties. 

- Ancient Egyptian culture revolved around the Nile river and its floods/harvests, as well as major deities like Ra and Osiris. Elaborate pyramids and rituals of mummification and funerary spells were important.

- The Old Kingdom saw the construction of large pyramids including the Great Pyramid of Giza. Egypt became an urban civilization with many cities and towns along the Nile. 

- The Middle Kingdom emerged after a period of instability, establishing Thebes as the capital. Egypt prospered under centralized rule and cultural developments. The New Kingdom expanded Egypt's power and wealth further.

- Key pharaohs included Sneferu, Khufu, Senusret II, Hatshepsut, Amenhotep III, Akhenaten, Tutankhamun, Ramses II. Egypt peaked but declined due to overextension, drought, and invasions.

 Here is a summary of the key points about the Bantu migrations:

- The Bantu migrations began around 1000 BCE as people from the Niger Delta region of West Africa started moving southward. This was likely due to population growth and environmental changes that made subsistence farming more difficult.

- The Bantu migrating peoples introduced iron smelting and improved agricultural techniques to central and southern Africa as they settled new lands. This facilitated the growth and spread of Bantu languages and cultural traditions. 

- Migration helped foster knowledge exchange between groups, leading to common arts, crafts, and cultural practices across broad areas. However, the migrations were not organized military conquests but rather gradual movements over many centuries.

- By around 500 CE, Bantu groups had settled most of central, eastern, and southern Africa, adopting local practices but also spreading their own innovations and language family. This transformed the cultures and genetics of sub-Saharan Africa.

 Here are the key points about the Lost Library of Alexandria:

- Ptolemy I Soter, ruler of Egypt, set out to create a library that housed copies of every book in the world in around 300 BCE. This became the Great Library of Alexandria. 

- It was inspired by Demetrius of Phalerum, one of Soter's advisers, and located in the Mouseion cultural center in Alexandria. 

- Ptolemy II Philadelphus expanded the library and created the Royal Library nearby. All books brought to or written in Alexandria were kept in these collections. 

- At its peak the library held up to 500,000 scrolls. A satellite library, the Serapeum, was later built to house additional scrolls. 

- In around 240 BCE the scholar Callimachus surveyed and cataloged the entire contents of the library. His catalog listed scrolls by subject and is considered the earliest known library catalog. However, it is now mostly lost.

- The library suffered losses over the centuries and was eventually destroyed, with its location and contents lost. This marked the loss of ancient knowledge and learning.

 Here is a summary of key events in the timeline provided:

- 1st century CE: The Soninke people emerge as a powerful force in West Africa, establishing the empire of Ghana which will last until the 11th century. 

- 2nd century CE: The kingdom of Aksum emerges as a unified state in what is now Ethiopia.

- 2nd century CE: Christianity begins to spread in areas of North Africa controlled by the Roman Empire. 

- 7th century CE: The Muslim conquest of North Africa results in the regions falling under Islamic rule and a transition from Latin to Arabic as the prominent language. 

- 8th century CE: The empire of Ghana reaches its peak, controlling trade routes across the Sahara desert. At the same time, regional kingdoms emerge throughout West Africa.

- 9th century CE: The Sudanic kingdoms like Kanem and Bornu arise in the central Sahara and Sahel regions, controlling trans-Saharan trade.

So in summary, the timeline outlines the emergence of early empires and states in Africa between 1-800CE, including Ghana, Aksum, the transition to Islamic rule in North Africa, and the rise of kingdoms controlling Saharan and sub-Saharan trade networks. Christianity also begins spreading in northern regions during this period.

 

- The Aksum (Axum) kingdom emerged in northern Ethiopia/Eritrea around 1st century CE and became a major trading power between 3rd-6th centuries CE. 

- It dominated trade routes between the Mediterranean, Arabia, and Indian Ocean, exporting goods like ivory, gold, spices and importing oil, wine, spices from Rome and India.

- Aksum's wealth came from agriculture (wheat, barley), iron production, and控制 over lucrative Red Sea trade routes via the port of Adulis. 

- It began minting coins in 270 CE in Greek with king's head, expanding influence over southern Arabia and rivaling Sabaean kingdom. 

- At its height, Aksum controlled territories from Ethiopia to Yemen and was named one of the top 4 great kingdoms by a 3rd century Persian prophet. Trade links extended as far as India.

- Christianity was introduced to the region in 4th century CE and became the official religion under King Ezana in 330 CE, though the kingdom declined by 800 CE.

 

- Christianity spread from Palestine into North Africa in the early 2nd century CE as the region was part of the Roman Empire. 

- Early centers included Egypt, Carthage, Numidia (eastern Algeria and western Tunisia), Ethiopia, and Nubia. 

- North African Christians faced persecution from Roman rulers who demanded worship of Roman/Hellenistic gods. 

- One of the first African martyrs was Perpetua, a 22-year-old mother from Carthage who was martyred around 203 CE. 

- Executions failed to stop Christianity's growth as martyrs were revered and inspired new converts. 

- Monastic communities developed in the deserts which helped spread the faith. Major figures included St. Augustine of Hippo in the 4th-5th centuries.

- Christianity gained prominence after Emperor Theodosius made it the official Roman religion in 380 CE, though Vandal invasions in the 5th century disrupted the church.

- It remained dominant in parts of Africa until replaced by Islam from the 7th century onward via the spread of Arabic peoples and conquests.

 

- The Ghana Empire was located in West Africa from around 300-11th century CE. It was one of the earliest and most powerful empires in sub-Saharan Africa. 

- Ghana controlled trans-Saharan trade routes across the western Sahel region. Gold mined to the south was a key export traded for salt and other goods from North Africa. This trade fueled Ghana's wealth and power.

- At its peak, Ghana's influence extended across the Sahel and north to the Mediterranean. It was the first empire and major power in West Africa, preceding the Mali Empire. 

- Ghana's wealth and authority declined in the later centuries due to disrupted trade from attacks by Berber Muslims, as well as rebellions within its territory. This eventually led to the rise of the Mali Empire as the dominant power in the region.

 

- The Ghana Empire was one of the earliest and greatest West African empires, centered in what is now Mali and Mauritania. It flourished from the 9th to the 11th centuries CE through trans-Saharan trade. 

- Ghana controlled lucrative gold and salt trade routes across the Sahara, levying taxes on goods. Gold from West African mines was traded north for salt and other commodities. 

- At its height, Ghana grew wealthy and powerful. The capital was likely the city of Koumbi Saleh. Arab sources describe grand palaces and a ruler dressed in gold. 

- Ghana began declining in the 11th-12th centuries as the rulers of the Mali Empire expanded their control of trade. Mali's ruler Sundiata eventually conquered Ghana. Later empires like Songhai also rose to prominence through trans-Saharan trade networks.

 

- Slavery had long been an accepted part of Arab and African societies before the rise of Islam. When the Islamic Empire expanded rapidly after Muhammad's death in 632 CE, Islamic law prohibited enslaving other Muslims. 

- In 652 CE, the Treaty of Baqt established an exchange where a neighboring Nubian kingdom would provide 300 enslaved people per year to the Arabs in Egypt, marking the beginning of the trans-Saharan slave trade. 

- African societies already had internal slave trades driven by labor demands. As Islamic influence spread across North Africa, Muslim merchants began commercially acquiring enslaved people on the southern Saharan frontier to sell elsewhere. 

- Over centuries, the trans-Saharan slave trade grew significantly in volume as sub-Saharan African kingdoms raided each other for captives to sell northward across the desert. Enslaved people were a chief commodity exchanged for North African goods. This disrupted many societies and accelerated the spread of Islam.

 

- Between 700-1500 CE, coastal cities known as the Swahili City-States emerged along the East African coast, dominated trade between Africa, Arabia, and Asia due to monsoon winds. 

- Originating from Bantu-speaking farmers and fishermen, these settlements like Kilwa, Zanzibar, and Pate developed hybrid Swahili cultures blending African, Arab, and Persian influences through extended cultural exchange during trading periods. 

- Trade of gold, ivory, steel, and other goods from the interior paid for magnificent stone architecture. Kilwa's royal palace had over 100 rooms. 

- Starting in the 16th century, Portuguese invasions led to the decline of the city-states. Omani Arabs then took control, making Zanzibar a trading post for enslaved people working plantations. 

- Swahili oral traditions and epic poetry still reflect the region's turbulent history and cultural exchanges over many centuries of long-distance maritime trade. Archaeological excavations continue to uncover more of the African foundations of these early civilization centers.

 

- In 711 CE, Tariq ibn Ziyad led a Moorish army from North Africa into the Iberian Peninsula, initiating Moorish rule in the region known as Al-Andalus. 

- Over the next decade, Moorish armies completed the conquest, establishing the western region of the Islamic world centered in Córdoba. 

- Al-Andalus reached its peak in the 10th century under the Caliphate of Córdoba, becoming a center of learning and intellectual achievement for Muslims, Jews, and Christians. 

- Internal conflicts in the 11th century fragmented Al-Andalus into warring kingdoms, allowing the Christian Reconquista to gradually retake territory. 

- The Emirate of Granada was the last Moorish territory, finally surrendering to the Spanish Crown in 1492, ending over 800 years of Moorish rule in Iberia.

- The Moors left a lasting cultural and architectural influence on Spain and Portugal, including many Arabic words and structures like the Alhambra palace.

 

The Zanj slave rebellion took place from 869-883 CE in southern Iraq, which was part of the Abbasid Caliphate. Thousands of enslaved East Africans known as Zanj had been transported to the region to drain and cultivate marshlands. They lived in poor conditions and revolted under the leadership of Ali ibn Muhammad, a Persian scholar who gained their support using the ideology of the anti-authoritarian Kharijite sect of Islam. 

The Zanj rebels seized control of the marshlands and built fortified communities. They raided towns and defeated imperial forces sent against them. By 870 they had established their own fortified city called al-Mukhtar. At their height they took the city of Basra in 871 and inflicted revenge on its inhabitants. The rebellion was a significant uprising that demonstrated the resilience and unity of the enslaved Africans against their oppressors. It highlighted the risks of the slave trade and plantation system established by the Muslim rulers.

 

UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Zimbabwe was the center of a powerful empire from the 11th-15th centuries located in modern-day Zimbabwe. An urban complex of stone walls and enclosures housed up to 20,000 people. It was the hub of a trading network spanning East Africa and the Indian Ocean, exchanging gold and other metals for goods from China, the Middle East, and Persia. The Empire declined by the 15th century, but Great Zimbabwe represents a unique African civilization and the highest achievement of Bantu-speaking peoples in Southern Africa, as seen through its advanced masonry and role in regional trade and power. It was later plundered before its historical significance was recognized in the 20th century.

 

- The Kanem Empire emerged in the 9th century CE in what is now Chad, controlling trans-Saharan trade routes between North Africa and West Africa. This brought it wealth and power. 

- By the 10th century, the kingdom had become wealthier and established some permanent settlements like the cities of Manan and Tarazaki with mudbrick buildings. 

- In the 11th century it adopted Islam as its state religion, spread by scholars and merchants traveling along trade routes. Ideas and people spread along with goods. 

- Enslaved people captured from other territories were exchanged along these routes for luxuries like cloth, jewelry and horses. 

- In the 14th century the Bulala people invaded Kanem, forcing the ruling Seifuwa dynasty to relocate to Bornu where they eventually assimilated the indigenous So people. 

- At its height, the Kanem Empire ruled over territories across northeast Nigeria, northeast Cameroon, eastern Niger, western Chad and southern Libya.

 

The beginnings of Benin started around 900 CE as small agricultural settlements along the Niger River became united to protect themselves from external threats. They were ruled by kings called Ogiso. In the 12th century, the last Ogiso king was weak and deposed, replaced by a republic led by Evian. Near the end of Evian's rule, he tried to establish a dynasty by naming his son as successor, angering local chiefs. 

The chiefs sought a neutral ruler from neighboring kingdom of Ife. Ife's king Oduduwa sent his son Oranmiyan, who defeated Evian's son and established a new dynasty. Oranmiyan married a local woman and had a son Eweka. In around 1200, Oranmiyan abdicated, leaving Eweka to become the first Oba (king) of Benin under the new dynasty. The Obas gradually expanded Benin into a powerful empire centered around its fortified capital city of Benin, dominating trade in the region in the 15th-17th centuries.

 

- The Mali Empire arose in West Africa in the 13th century, replacing the declining Ghana Empire. 

- It was founded by Sundiata Keita, a prince from the Malinke kingdom of Kangabe. After the Ghana Empire collapsed, Sundiata conquered neighboring states and established the capital of the new Mali Empire at Niani.

- At its height, the Mali Empire was the largest of three great West African empires and a major center of both trade and Islamic scholarship. The empire declined in the 15th century, when the Songhai Empire rose to power.

- Mali's techniques in metalworking, especially brass, were influenced by Ife city-states in present-day Nigeria, with whom Mali sustained close trading links. Mali artists also adopted sculpture styles from the earlier Aksum civilization in Ethiopia.

- The epic poem about Sundiata Keita celebrates his role in liberating the Malinke people and founding the Mali Empire, likening him to a "lion lord." Under Sundiata and his successors, Mali grew into a wealthy and powerful empire spanning centuries.

 

- The Great Mosque of Djenné is founded in the 13th century in what is now Mali. 

- Djenné was an important urban center and trading post located along important trans-Saharan trade routes. 

- According to legend, a wealthy resident of Djenné built the original structure of the mosque to please God in a public act of piety. He turned his palace into a place of worship. 

- The Great Mosque was constructed using adobe bricks and timber beams. It became an important center of Islam, learning, and helped spread Islam in West Africa. 

- By the 19th century the original structure had fallen into ruin. It was reconstructed in 1907 by Djenné's guild of masons using the same mud brick techniques. 

- Today the Great Mosque remains an iconic structure and represents community cohesion in Djenné. With its reconstruction it is the finest example of Sudano-Sahelian architectural style.

 

- The city-states of Hausaland, located in what is now northern Nigeria, flourished in the 15th century through trans-Saharan trade, local skills, and resources. 

- The independent city-states developed from walled villages and grew into powerful trading centers, governed by emirs who controlled surrounding farmlands. 

- The Fulani people established the Sokoto Caliphate in Hausaland in 1804, unifying the region's emirates and states under a single government for the first time. 

- The city-states were important hubs along the trans-Saharan trade routes, linking West African empires like Mali and Songhai with North Africa and the Mediterranean. They imported goods like salt, horses, and textiles and exported crops, leather works, and dyed clothes known as "indigo blue."

- Europeans first made contact with the city-states in the late 15th century. British colonialism disrupted the region's political systems in the late 19th century. Today, the Hausa people remain dominant culturally and linguistically across much of northern Nigeria and parts of neighboring countries.

 

From the 15th-18th centuries, the Maasai people migrated southward from what is now South Sudan to Kenya and northern Tanzania in search of fresh pasture for their cattle herds. As pastoral nomads dependent on cattle for their livelihood, the Maasai followed migration routes that took them across the Great Rift Valley region. During this multi-century migration, they assimilated or displaced many smaller ethnic groups. By the mid-19th century, the Maasai occupied much of the Great Rift Valley territory. However, in the late 19th-early 20th centuries, disease epidemics and land loss due to European colonization greatly reduced Maasai numbers and territory. More recently, urbanization and modernization have challenged traditional Maasai pastoralist culture and way of life.

 The passage discusses trade between China and East Africa during the Ming dynasty in the early 15th century, when the Chinese emperor Yongle commissioned naval voyages led by Admiral Zheng He to establish trade. Some key points:

- Zheng He led voyages from 1405 to 1433 that reached East Africa, among other places, establishing trade relations. 

- China and East Africa had engaged in indirect trade for over 1000 years as part of a larger trade network connecting Asia, Africa, and Europe. 

- The voyages aimed to demonstrate China's power and satisfy demand for exotic goods, not conquest or territory. Zheng He traded with East Africans as equals.

- Goods traded included Chinese silk and porcelain exchanged for African ivory, animal skins, tortoise shell. This enriched East African societies but also increased social hierarchies. 

- China ended the voyages in 1433 and maintained no permanent presence, though archaeological evidence remains of their past connection. Trade relationships were commercial rather than colonial.



- Zheng He's voyages occurred between 1405-1433 from China primarily to Southeast Asia, India, East Africa, and Arabia. His massive fleet of hundreds of ships exchanged gifts to establish diplomatic relations and acquire rare animals, resources, and people.  
- On his voyages, Zheng explored ports along East Africa's coast as far as modern-day Mozambique, acquiring giraffes and African ambassadors. His fleet helped establish trade networks between China, South Asia, East Africa, and the Persian Gulf region. However, the voyages were ultimately ended by the Chinese court.

- Africans lived in Tudor-era England and Scotland in the 16th-17th centuries as free citizens. They worked in a variety of occupations and some achieved high status positions at royal courts. While they faced some societal prejudices, they were officially recognized as naturalized subjects according to available records. Their presence in Britain stretched back over 2000 years and communities existed in major port towns.

 

- The Kingdom of Kongo was ruled through succession of dynastic lineages supported by powerful factions. 

- In 1506, Afonso defeated his rival half-brother to become the sixth manikongo after the death of King João I. He converted Kongo into a Christian state aligned with Portugal.

- However, Afonso grew concerned with Portugal's expansion of the slave trade, which undermined Kongo society. He complained to the Portuguese king and Pope but had little success in regulating the trade. 

- Repeated succession crises and struggles between rival factions weakened Kongo and made it vulnerable to exploitation by European powers like Portugal through the expanding slave trade. This ultimately led to the breakdown and collapse of the once powerful kingdom.

 Here are the key points about the birth of the Atlantic slave trade in 1510:

- It began as Portugal started trafficking enslaved Africans extracted through raids and purchased from African rulers and merchants across West Africa to work on sugar plantations in their newly colonized islands in the Atlantic. 

- In 1510, Spain's King Ferdinand authorized a shipment of the first recorded group of enslaved Africans (around 50 people) to work on plantations in Hispaniola. This marked the official start of the Atlantic slave trade that would last until the 19th century.

- Over the following centuries, other European powers like Britain, France, Denmark, and the Netherlands entered the lucrative slave trade, fueled by the growing demand for plantation labor in the Americas to cultivate crops like sugar, tobacco, and cotton.

- It's estimated that between 1510-1866, around 12.5 million Africans were forcibly transported across the Atlantic, though the actual numbers will never be known. Their treatment and the horrors of the Middle Passage have left an indelible stain on human history.

 The summary provided some key details about the history of the Atlantic slave trade:

- The slave trade began in the 15th century as Portugal and Spain started exploring and colonizing Africa and the Americas. They initially used enslaved Africans for labor on sugar plantations and as domestic servants. 

- Over time, other European powers like Britain, France, the Netherlands, and the US joined the trade. They transported enslaved Africans from ports on the west coast of Africa to colonies in the Americas in the "middle passage."

- Conditions on slave ships were horrific, with enslaved people packed tightly below deck in inhumane conditions where disease spread rapidly. 

- The slave trade formed a "triangle trade," with ships exchanging enslaved Africans for goods in Africa, transporting them across the Atlantic, and returning to Europe with commodities from the Americas. 

- It's estimated that over 12 million Africans were transported during the slave trade from the 15th to 19th centuries. The trade disrupted societies in Africa and created an enduring African diaspora spread across the Americas.

 

- Enslaved people from Africa and their descendants were forced to work on plantations in the Americas for over 300 years, from the 16th century until 1888 in Brazil. 

- Large plantations grew crops like sugar, tobacco, rice, coffee, and cotton in the Caribbean, Latin America, and the American South. The Spanish first established sugar plantations in Hispaniola in the early 1500s using enslaved Indigenous people and then Africans.

- Enslaved people faced extremely harsh and deadly conditions. 30% of those transported across the Atlantic died from disease in the Americas. Life expectancy on plantations was as low as 7-9 years and child mortality as high as 90%. 

- Larger Caribbean and Latin American plantations had hundreds of enslaved people, mostly men, outnumbering white populations. Enslaved people were worked extremely hard, up to 18 hours a day with no breaks. 

- Tobacco plantations developed in Virginia in the 1600s-1700s using over 100,000 enslaved people. Cotton plantations expanded in the American South in the early 1800s. 

- Enslaved women and children faced additional burdens. Women were seen as "breeding stock" and reproduction was encouraged to replenish the enslaved population.

 

- Enslaved people lived in basic dwellings like huts or cabins with few furnishings. Conditions were often terrible. 

- Work was difficult, from very young ages. Younger children and older/frail people did lighter work, while the able-bodied endured intense labor demands on plantations. 

- Enslavers controlled enslaved people through punishments like beatings, whippings, torture and mutilation. Enslaved people were considered property with no rights.

- Enslavers forced breeding of enslaved women to increase profits, and often raped enslaved women. Children born to enslaved mothers were also enslaved. 

- Enslaved people maintained community and culture through religion, song, language and underground gatherings despite rules against such things. Over 250 uprisings occurred in resistance to conditions.

- Enslavement began to end in the 1800s through emancipation acts, but freedom came at huge hardship and cost for many newly freed people.

 

- In 1570, an enslaved African man named Gaspar Yanga led a successful slave revolt on a sugar plantation in Veracruz, Mexico. 

- Between the 1520s and the start of the Mexican War of Independence in 1810, around 250,000 Africans were imported to Mexico to work as slaves on plantations, in mines, and as domestic servants. 

- Over 100 rebellions and conspiracies were recorded during the three centuries of African enslavement in Mexico. 

- The influx of enslaved Africans was prompted by a decline in the indigenous population, which fell from over 27 million in 1519 to just over 1 million in 1605 due to disease and overwork. 

- Spain encouraged the use of enslaved Africans to replace indigenous workers. Enslaved Africans experienced brutal treatment, and mounting resentment led to many individual and organized uprisings across Mexico. 

- Gaspar Yanga's 1570 revolt in Veracruz was the most successful, allowing him and his followers to establish a free town called San Lorenzo de los Negros.

 Here are the key points about slavery resistance camps in Brazil:

- The Portuguese established colonies and plantations in Brazil in the early 1500s, initially growing crops like sugar cane for export to Europe. This required vast amounts of labor. 

- They first used enslaved Indigenous people but disease devastated these populations. So they began importing enslaved Africans in large numbers starting in the 1530s.

- The sugar and mining industries depended on enslaved labor. Some enslaved workers escaped from the harsh conditions and founded permanent settlements called quilombos in dense jungle and remote mountain areas for protection.

- The largest and most famous of these was founded by Zumbi and was located in Palmares in northeastern Brazil. It had a population of over 20,000 inhabitants at its peak in the 1600s.

- The quilombos resisted recapture and hostile incursions for decades. The Portuguese saw them as a threat and challenge to the slave system. Palmares only fell after a major military campaign in 1694.

- The quilombos demonstrated the resistance of enslaved peoples to their condition and served as a refuge for runaways. Their existence highlighted the conflicts inherent in Brazil's slave-based colonial economy.

 

Nzinga was the queen of the Ndongo and Matamba kingdoms in modern-day Angola in the early 1600s. The Portuguese had established a colony on the island of Luanda in 1575 and were expanding their influence on the African mainland, seeking resources and enslaved people to send to their American colonies. When Nzinga's brother became king of Ndongo after their father's death, he signed a treaty with the Portuguese allowing them to establish coastal forts. However, the Portuguese went back on the agreement and invaded further inland. 

Nzinga opposed the Portuguese invasion and took over rule of Ndongo after her brother's death. She defeated the Portuguese in battle and negotiated treaties to curb their encroachment. However, the Portuguese continued raiding Ndongo for resources and enslaved people. Nzinga temporarily allied with the Portuguese governor by converting to Christianity but maintained her traditional beliefs. She later established the kingdom of Matamba when the Portuguese conquered Ndongo after her death in 1671. Nzinga successfully slowed the Portuguese invasion for decades through skilled military and diplomatic tactics, establishing her reputation as a formidable queen and warrior.

 

Queen Nzinga of the Mbundu kingdom of Ndongo fought against Portuguese encroachment and the slave trade since the establishment of the Portuguese colony of Luanda in 1575. As a skilled military leader from a young age, she realized the threat posed by the Portuguese. 

By the late 16th century, Portugal and Spain had claimed large territories in the Americas through slave trading. They began moving further into Nzinga's territory along the African coast. After ascending to the throne of Ndongo, Nzinga allied with Portugal but tensions grew as they backed a rival ruler. She was eventually forced to flee to the nearby kingdom of Matamba.

From Matamba, Nzinga formed alliances and fought battles against the Portuguese and their allies for over 30 years, seeking to defend her people and reclaim her lands. She recruited soldiers, encouraged rebellions, and allied with the Dutch for a time. Despite losses, she continued resisting the Portuguese invasion from Matamba.

By the end of her life, Nzinga had controlled lucrative trade routes and territories. She welcomed people seeking refuge from slavery to strengthen her kingdom. Today, she is honored for her leadership and military skills in fighting colonialism and the slave trade as the "Mother of Angola."

 

- In 1680, Osei Tutu united several Akan states in Ghana to form the Asante Empire. 

- According to legend, upon declaring himself Asantehene (paramount king), Osei Tutu received a golden stool from heaven as a symbol of his leadership. 

- The empire flourished due to its gold trade and military conquests led by Osei Tutu. It grew to control much of modern Ghana and Ivory Coast over the next 200+ years.

- The Asante Empire introduced kente cloth and became a powerful political/cultural force in West Africa, lasting until it was defeated by the British in 1896. Its legacy still influences the region today.

 

In the late 17th century, as the Mutapa kingdom in present-day Zimbabwe was weakening due to challenges from Portuguese invaders seeking to control the gold trade, a wealthy cattle owner named Changamire Dombo broke away and formed his own independent army called the Rozvi or "destroyers." Dombo was disillusioned with Mutapa's failure to stop Portuguese encroachment. The effectiveness of Dombo's army earned him the title "Changamire," which means "the one who separates himself." Under Dombo, the Rozvi Empire emerged among the Shona people and came to dominate the region during a time of civil wars, establishing themselves as a new power centered around the city of Danangombe. The Rozvi Empire lasted until the 1830s when the Ndebele people arrived in the area from South Africa and overthrew them.

 Here are summaries of the key passages:

- François Bernier was the first to publish a classification of human races in 1684, dividing people into four groups based on geographic origin and physical characteristics like skin tone. 

- By the 18th century, the two main theories on human origins were monogenism (one origin) and polygenism (multiple origins). Proponents of each side debated the implications for intellectual and moral capacities.

- In 1735, Carl Linnaeus published a classification system for all living things, including four human races defined by continent and described in part by skin color and traits. 

- In 1753, Linnaeus asserted his belief that "negroes" were inferior to whites, which was later cited by pro-slavery advocates. 

- Samuel Morton claimed skull studies showed racial brain capacity differences, an idea known as "scientific racism" that was used to defend racial inequality. Franz Boas opposed this view.

 

- The period from 1700-1900 saw increasing resistance to oppression by Africans and people of African descent around the world, as European colonialism and the transatlantic slave trade disrupted communities and dehumanized millions.

- Ongoing frontier wars in Southern Africa exemplified clashes over land and resources as Europeans expanded. Enslaved Africans resisted through rebellions like the Haitian Revolution and Nat Turner's revolt. 

- The transatlantic slave trade ideology of anti-Blackness was challenged by intellectuals like Equiano and Douglass. Abolitionism spread in Europe and America in the late 18th century.

- Slavery was abolished in British colonies in 1833 and in the US after the Civil War in 1865, though freed slaves faced ongoing racism. African kingdoms also resisted European invasion, like Ethiopia's victory over Italy in 1896.

- The 1880s Berlin Conference partitioned Africa without African consent, overlaying new political boundaries. By 1900 most of the continent was under European colonial rule, reshaping Africa's political structures.

 The passage provides context about the warrior women of Dahomey in the kingdom of Dahomey in present-day Benin in West Africa. Some key details:

- The Mino were an all-female military regiment that formed part of the army of the Kingdom of Dahomey from around 1708. They were established by Queen Hangbe and became a formal part of the army under King Ghezo in 1818. 

- Young women and girls as young as 9 years old would vow to be virgins and join the Mino, where they underwent rigorous training to be strong, pain-resistant, and ruthless fighters who would decapitate enemies swiftly. 

- Serving in the elite Mino regiment offered women high social status, privileges, and influence within the kingdom. They played frontline roles in the kingdom's campaigns and slave raids.

- The Mino were finally wiped out in the 1890s during the Second Franco-Dahomean War as they faced superior French firearms. Their disbandment contributed to the overthrow of the Dahomey king.

- Today the kingdom of Dahomey no longer exists, with its territory now part of the modern nation of Benin. The Mino warrior women, once feared across West Africa, left a legacy as a unique all-female military unit.

 The passage summarizes the growth of abolitionism against the transatlantic slave trade in Europe during the 18th-19th centuries. Some key points:

- Britain, France, Spain, Portugal, and Netherlands were heavily involved in the slave trade by the 18th century to fuel colonies in Americas. 

- Abolitionism began building in late 18th century, led by activists like Thomas Clarkson who campaigned to change public opinion on viewing enslaved people as human. 

- The 1772 Somersett case in Britain established no one could be forcibly enslaved on British soil, undermining the idea of property rights in people.

- Abolitionists produced images like the kneeling slave pleading "Am I Not A Man And A Brother?" to force public to see enslaved people as having human dignity. 

- Britain abolished slavery in 1833-1834 but compensated slave owners, showing power of pro-slavery interests. Anti-slavery efforts then focused on policing slavery globally.

So in summary, it outlines the growth of European powers' involvement in the slave trade and the beginnings of organized abolitionist movements in the late 18th century challenging views of slavery.

 

- Frederick Douglass, a formerly enslaved man, pointed out the contradiction between American Independence Day celebrating freedom and justice, while millions of enslaved people had neither freedom nor justice. 

- In the 16th and 17th centuries, Quaker meetings like the Philadelphia Meeting of Friends began discouraging and outlawing slavery. 

- In 1758, the influential Philadelphia Yearly Meeting condemned slavery and encouraged Quakers to free their slaves. This was one of the first organized protest against slavery in the Americas.

- Starting in the late 18th century, the number of Black abolitionists started to grow, with individuals like Olaudah Equiano publishing influential narratives describing the horrors of slavery and making the case against the Atlantic slave trade. 

- In the early 19th century, William Lloyd Garrison emerged as a key white abolitionist, founding the Liberator newspaper which attacked slavery and promoted immediate emancipation. This intensified the growing abolitionist movement in the northern U.S.

- The gap between slavery and freedom highlighted by Douglass on Independence Day showed how the principles of the Declaration of Independence did not apply to millions of enslaved people. It condemned the contradiction at the heart of American democracy for Black people.

 

- In the 18th century, Quaker groups and others began campaigning against slavery, seeing it as evil and against principles of humanity and liberty. John Woolman urged Quakers to free enslaved people. 

- The American Revolution raised hypocrisy about denying freedom while seeking independence. Early abolitionist societies formed to educate the public and lobby politicians against slavery.

- Slavery persisted in British colonies and Southern US despite bans on the slave trade. Enslaved people and their descendants remained unfree. 

- Frederick Douglass and Sojourner Truth were prominent African American activists who escaped slavery and advocated for its abolition through speeches, writings, and political work. 

- In the 1820s, the abolitionist movement in the US stepped up efforts with petitions, pamphlets, speeches and transatlantic conventions. Sarah Parker Remond and others connected abolitionism to women's rights. 

- Britain abolished slavery in 1833. The US and Brazil remained centers of slavery despite international bans. Douglass emerged as a leading Black abolitionist, advocating immediate emancipation and suffrage for freedmen.

 

- The Xhosa Wars were a series of nine conflicts between 1799-1878 in what is now Eastern Cape, South Africa between Dutch/British colonists and the indigenous Xhosa people. 

- The conflicts arose as Dutch farmers (Trekboers) expanded eastward into Xhosa lands in search of territory, competing with Xhosa herders for land and water resources. 

- The early wars from 1779-1801 were between Boer frontier farmers and British troops against the Xhosa. 

- In 1856, a Xhosa prophetess named Nongqawuse claimed ancestors said the dead would rise if Xhosa destroyed their cattle and crops, in response to a cattle disease. Many Xhosa complied and destroyed much of their livelihood, weakening their resistance.

- By the late 1870s, the Xhosa had lost most of their territory to British colonists. The final war in 1877-78 seized the last Xhosa lands, marking the end of the conflicts and absorption into the British Cape Colony. 

- The wars stemmed from increasing clashes over land and resources as Dutch/British settlers expanded into Xhosa territory in South Africa over nearly a century.

 

- The Haitian Revolution was a series of slave revolts and military uprisings that took place in the French colony of Saint-Domingue (present-day Haiti) between 1791-1804. 

- It resulted in the abolition of slavery in Saint-Domingue in 1793 and the establishment of Haiti as an independent nation in 1804, the first post-colonial state led by black revolutionary armies in Latin America and the Caribbean.

- Saint-Domingue was a highly profitable French sugar colony that employed brutal practices of slavery. By the late 18th century, conditions for the enslaved population were very harsh, fueling rebellious activities by Maroon communities. 

- The rebellion began in 1791, influenced by the ideas of the French Revolution. A slave uprising in the northern plains in 1791 was followed by the southern insurrection of 1793-1794 led by Toussaint Louverture. 

- Louverture allied the rebellion with the French Republican forces and helped France defeat the British, who tried to seize control of the island. Slavery was abolished in Saint-Domingue in 1793.

- After gaining control, Louverture promulgated a new constitution in 1801 establishing an autonomous black-run state. However, Napoleon Bonaparte sent an expedition to restore slavery and white control in 1802.

- Jean-Jacques Dessalines completed the Haitian Revolution and declared Haitian independence on January 1, 1804, establishing the Republic of Haiti, the first free black republic in the world.

 

- Spain began transporting African slaves to Hispaniola (present-day Haiti and Dominican Republic) to work on plantations in the 1500s. torture and executions of rebellious Maroon leaders like François Makandal took place. 

- In 1791, a massive slave rebellion broke out led by figures like Toussaint Louverture and inspired by a Vodou ceremony. Over the next few years, around 100,000 slaves rebelled and plantations were destroyed. 

- France abolished slavery in 1794 due to the rebellion, although it was reinstated later. Toussaint Louverture helped the French defeat the British and Spanish who were also trying to control the colony. 

- Toussaint declared himself governor for life in 1801 and issued a constitution abolishing slavery. But Napoleon sent troops to arrest Toussaint and reassert French control, aiming to reintroduce slavery.

- After Toussaint's arrest, generals like Dessalines and Christophe took over the rebellion. They defeated the French attempts to restore slavery and declared independence in 1804, renaming the country Haiti.

- The Haitian revolution was the only successful slave revolt, leading to the establishment of the first black republic in the world. It struck a major blow to slavery worldwide.

 Here is a summary of the passage:

The Underground Railroad was a secret network that helped enslaved African Americans escape to free states and Canada in the late 18th and early-to-mid 19th centuries. It originated from individual Quakers and abolitionists providing aid but grew into a complex system utilizing various safe houses along escape routes. Enthusiasm increased due to the growing abolition movement and worsening fugitive slave laws. 

Locations like barns, churches and secret compartments in houses served as stations where conductors guided freedom seekers along routes primarily from border slave states to the North. Notable conductors included Harriet Tubman, who made over 13 rescue missions and helped hundreds escape despite facing death if caught. Participants developed code words to maintain secrecy and faced punishments if exposed. The campaign ultimately facilitated thousands reaching freedom in Northern states and Canada despite efforts of slave catchers. It demonstrated growing resistance to the institution of slavery in the decades prior to the American Civil War.

 

- The Zulu people originated as part of the Bantu migration into Southern Africa around 1500 CE. They settled in what is now South Africa, Eswatini, and Mozambique. 

- In the 17th-18th centuries, the Zulu began emerging as an independent force under various chieftains who conquered neighboring groups and amassed power.

- In the late 18th century, King Shaka Zulu united the Zulu peoples and launched a period of expansion, building the most powerful empire in Southern Africa through military conquest. 

- When the British expanded their empire into Southern Africa in the 19th century, they encountered resistance from the Zulu, culminating in the Anglo-Zulu War of 1879. Zulu forces inflicted major defeats on the British Army.

- After 1887, British rule was established over Zulu lands through annexation and absorption into the colony of Natal. However, the Zulu maintained aspects of separate identity and resistance to full domination. Their historical resistance against a major colonial power added to their legacy.

 

- In 1820, the ship Elizabeth sailed from New York carrying 88 Black Americans seeking a better life in Africa. They were settling in what would become Liberia under the American Colonization Society (ACS), which aimed to repatriate free Black people to Africa. 

- Many of the early settlers died from disease. It took almost two years to secure land from local leaders to establish a colony. In 1822, they founded Monrovia as the capital of the new colony, later named Liberia. 

- By the 1840s, around 16,000 Black Americans had been resettled in Liberia by the ACS and other societies. They became known as Americo-Liberians and dominated politically and economically, though only a small fraction of the population. 

- Liberia declared independence in 1847. In 2005, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf became Africa's first female head of state after two civil wars that bitterly divided the country.

- Though envisioned as a homeland, most Black Americans opposed colonization schemes, seeing them as a form of deportation. The Liberian settlers encountered resistance from indigenous peoples whose lands they occupied. Relations remained tense.

 

The Zanzibar slave trade took place in the 1840s on the island of Zanzibar off the coast of Tanzania. Zanzibar was controlled by Omani Arabs and had become a prominent hub for the Arab-led East African slave trade. Enslaved Africans from across East Africa were captured and transported by dhow to the island, where many died during the horrific journey. Survivors were kept in underground cells and inspected at the public slave market in Stone Town before being sold. Both male and female slaves fetched high prices and were exported to other Arab countries for labor. The trade continued until the late 1800s when British intervention led to the closure of slave markets and full abolition of slavery on the island by the early 1900s. The slave trade had made Zanzibar very wealthy through its clove and coconut plantations worked by enslaved people. It remained a sobering reminder of the Arab role in historical African enslavement.

 

- The demand for cheap labor on the island of Zanzibar rose as its economy grew, as well as in other Arab countries where slave labor was scarce. 

- Soon, the streets of Stone Town, the capital of Zanzibar, were full of enslaved people. The town's market had become East Africa's largest slave market. 

- As the island's economy grew based on clove plantations and the slave trade, the demand for slaves increased, further fueling the slave trade on the island and the surrounding region.

 

- The 13th Amendment was passed, abolishing slavery, and was ratified. Lincoln never saw this happen as he was assassinated on April 14, 1865, five days after the war ended. 

- During Reconstruction from 1865-1877, there were efforts to integrate freed slaves into society through initiatives like the Freedmen's Bureau which provided aid. Schools were also set up for black children.

- However, southern states resisted and imposed "Black Codes" restricting black rights. Meanwhile, southern mobs lynched blacks to assert white supremacy, as the legal status of blacks as equal citizens was still being debated and enacted. The 14th and 15th Amendments were eventually passed to grant blacks citizenship and voting rights.

- Reconstruction programs saw some progress with blacks gaining education and political office, but sharecropping also kept many in poverty and debt, and the end of Reconstruction in 1877 saw a rollback of protections for blacks. The civil rights struggle continued into the 20th century.

 Here is a summary of the key points about Jim Crow:

- Jim Crow refers to the system of racial segregation and discrimination that operated in the American South between 1877-1964, after the end of Reconstruction following the Civil War. 

- It was designed to continue oppressing Black Americans and replicating theprevious slave codes. Black codes imposed forced labor contracts and restricted occupations for Black people.

- In response, Republicans passed the Reconstruction Amendments between 1865-1870 to protect civil rights for newly freed slaves and prohibit discrimination.

- However, after the disputed 1876 election, the new president agreed to remove federal troops enforcing Black rights in the South in exchange for home rule. 

- Southern states quickly established segregation laws on transportation. The Supreme Court's 1896 Plessy v. Ferguson decision upheld the constitutionality of racial segregation under the "separate but equal" doctrine.

- This legalized the system of Jim Crow laws that mandated segregation in all public facilities and services and denied many Black Americans of their right to equal treatment and opportunities. 

- Jim Crow oppression continued until dismantled through the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s, culminating in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 banning discrimination.

 Here is a summary of the Scramble for Africa from 1884-1885:

- In the late 19th century, European nations were seeking new sources of raw materials to fuel their growing industries after the Industrial Revolution. Their attention turned from the slave trade to colonizing Africa. 

- At the Berlin Conference in 1884-1885, Europe's powers met to divide up territories in Africa without input from African rulers and peoples. They drew boundaries according to their own interests with little regard for cultural and linguistic boundaries of African groups.

- Through treaties and military force, European nations imposed their imperial rule over much of Africa. They exploited natural resources and imposed policies that disrupted traditional African societies and economies. Quotas on cash crops disrupted traditional farming. 

- This Scramble for Africa led to the colonization of the entire continent, excluding Ethiopia (Abyssinia). European colonial powers dominated African politics and economies for much of the 20th century until independence movements in the post-WWII era.

 

- In the late 19th century, Brazil was the last Western Hemisphere nation to abolish slavery. It had imported over 4.9 million enslaved Africans since the 16th century to work on sugar and coffee plantations. 

- Pressure grew in Brazil for abolition in the 1800s, led by activists like Afro-Brazilian poet and lawyer Luís Gama. Laws were passed ending the slave trade in 1850 and freeing children born to enslaved mothers in 1871.

- In 1888, Princess Isabel signed the Golden Law, freeing the remaining 700,000 enslaved Brazilians. However, emancipation did little to immediately improve their conditions and many had to continue working for former masters.

- While slavery formally ended, its legacy of racism and inequality continued. Afro-Brazilians still face discrimination today. The anniversary of the Golden Law on May 13th is observed as the “unfinished abolition.” Brazil achieved legal freedom but full equality remained elusive.

 Here is a summary of the key events in 5 sentences:

The passage outlines important events and movements in the decolonization of Africa and the diasporas from 1900 to present. It begins with the First Pan-African Conference in 1900 and discusses uprisings against colonial rule like the Maji Maji revolt in Tanzania in 1905. The 1920s saw the founding of groups like the African National Congress in South Africa and the influential Harlem Renaissance in the US. Decolonization accelerated after World War 2 as nationalists pushed for independence, with Ghana becoming the first West African country to gain independence in 1957 under Kwame Nkrumah. The passage traces the impact of movements like Pan-Africanism, Negritude, and diaspora communities in places like the UK in shaping self-determination for people of African descent globally.

 

- Pan-Africanism emerged in the late 19th century as a political ideology promoting solidarity and common identity among people of African descent worldwide against oppression. Early proponents debated whether African Americans should emigrate to Africa or gain sovereignty within the United States. 

- Influential early thinkers included Edward Wilmot Blyden, who advocated for Black emigration and pride. W.E.B. Du Bois organized the seminal First Pan-African Conference in 1900.

- In the 1920s, Marcus Garvey's Back to Africa movement popularized Pan-Africanism through his United Negro Improvement Association, attracting millions of members. 

- Subsequent decades saw the growth of Pan-Africanist thought influenced by socialist ideas. Leaders included C.L.R. James, George Padmore, Frantz Fanon, and others. 

- Pan-Africanism influenced Black nationalist movements, the Harlem Renaissance, and the fight for independence across Africa in the lead-up to decolonization after World War II. It promoted a shared Black identity and rights movement across the African diaspora.

 Here are the key points about Black Wall Street:

- It was located in Greenwood, a district of Tulsa, Oklahoma that developed in the early 20th century. 

- The land was initially sold only to Black people by a wealthy Black landowner, allowing it to become a self-sufficient community for Black people.

- It flourished in the early 1900s as many Black settlers took advantage of the Oklahoma land rush to establish towns and communities. 

- Greenwood grew very prosperous, becoming known as "Black Wall Street" due to the success of Black-owned businesses located there. 

- It served as an example of a vibrant Black economy controlled by Black people, a rare thing at the time given the discrimination and barriers that existed in the U.S.

- However, the community was tragically destroyed in 1921 when it was attacked and burned in the Tulsa Race Massacre, one of the worst incidents of racial violence in U.S. history.

 Here is a summary of the key points about the Wes Act of 1887:

- The Dawes Act of 1887 was a US federal law that aimed to break up Native American tribal land holdings and redistribute the land to individual Native Americans and their families. 

- Under the Dawes Act, tribal land was broken up and divided into individual allotments for Native Americans. Each Native American family was allotted 160 acres of land. Remaining lands were deemed "surplus" and sold to non-Natives.

- The law was intended to "civilize" Native Americans by making them farmer by breaking up tribal organization and traditions. It undermined Native self-governance and disrupted tribal societies. 

- The Dawes Act led to over 90 million acres of Native American land passing out of tribal ownership and into the hands of non-Native settlers and speculators. Native Americans lost control over more than 1 million acres as a result of the law.

- The act contributed to Native American assimilation into mainstream American society and helped enable the expansion of non-Native settlements onto former tribal lands. It undermined tribal identities and self-governance.

 

- The Harlem Renaissance was a cultural movement centered in Harlem, NY from around 1918-1937 that inspired Black creativity in literature, art, music, and performance. 

- Factors fueling it included the Great Migration of Black people from the rural South to northern cities seeking improved social and economic opportunities. 

- Black writers and artists sought to authentically depict Black lives and traditions to counter racist stereotypes prevalent in mainstream culture. 

- Figures like W.E.B. Du Bois and Alain Locke promoted the movement to influence white society and advance Black civil rights through artistic excellence. 

- The New Negro anthology laid the foundation for future Black cultural expression by exploring African roots and a new Black American identity. 

- Writers like Langston Hughes, Zora Neale Hurston, and Countee Cullen produced innovative literature exploring the Black experience. 

- Jazz and blues musicians like those in Shuffle Along fueled performance arts with their music. 

- Visual artists depicted African traditions and championed Black figures through paintings and sculpture.

- Though diminished by the Great Depression, the Renaissance had a lasting impact on later Black artistic movements and global Black expression.

 Here is a summary of the key points about the history and origins of jazz:

- Jazz originated in New Orleans in the early 20th century as an amalgamation of musical traditions brought by enslaved Africans and European colonizers to the city, including blues, spirituals, work songs, military brass bands, and ragtime. Improvisation was a defining element. 

- Early jazz was played by bands using wind instruments, piano, and drums to produce infectious rhythms. It was largely improvised and expressive in nature. 

- The music gained widespread popularity in the 1920s known as the "Jazz Age" and crossed racial lines, appealing to white and black youth through dancing. It helped break down racial barriers to some extent.

- Early jazz greats like Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington achieved fame but faced racism, having to enter clubs through the back door. Armstrong's recordings in the 1920s greatly influenced the development of jazz.

- Precursors to jazz included blues music, originating in the American South in the 1860s, and ragtime in the 1890s pioneered by Scott Joplin, which influenced jazz's use of syncopation. 

- Swing arose in the 1930s as jazz bands grew larger, exemplified by Benny Goodman, and the jazz festival era drew to a close with a large outdoor festival in New York in 1938.

 

In 1929 in Oloko, Nigeria, thousands of Igbo women protested a British census and increased taxes by performing traditional rituals to shame local colonial officials. Led by Madame Nwanyeruwa, the women objected to being directly taxed despite financial dependence on their men, who were already taxed. Violent clashes occurred between protesters, numbering over 25,000, and British officials, resulting in over 50 deaths before the revolt ended in 1930. Inspired by the "Women's War," further tax protests occurred in 1938. The revolt paved the way for later anticlonial movements in Nigeria and the country's independence in 1959.

 Here are the key points about Black combatants in World War II:

- Black soldiers from colonies of European powers like Britain, France, and Belgium fought for the Allied forces against the Axis powers of Germany, Italy, and Japan. 

- Britain mobilized soldiers from its colonial regiments in West Africa but were reluctant to deploy African troops against white Europeans. These colonial forces were used in non-combatant roles or combat in Asia/Africa theaters. 

- France recruited over 500,000 troops from North and West African colonies. Some African units fought as frontline combatants in Europe, Italy, Sicily, and Germany, suffering heavy casualties and mass executions by Germany. 

- After the war, Black veterans faced difficulties in receiving benefits, pensions, and demobilization pay promised from Britain and France. This led to protests by veterans in colonies like Ghana. 

- The US recruited over 1 million Black Americans but faced reluctance from the Department of War in deploying them in combat roles early in the war until the famous 369th Infantry proved its merit in World War I. The "Double V" campaign urged victory over enemies abroad and racial discrimination at home.

So in summary, Black soldiers from colonies made significant contributions to Allied victories but faced neglect and discrimination in recognition from the same European powers they fought for. The struggle for equal treatment of Black veterans continued in the postwar period.

 Here is a summary of the key points from the passage:

- In the 1940s-1950s, thousands of Caribbean migrants arrived in the UK to help rebuild Britain after WWII. They were recruited by the British government which promised them employment and the right to settle in Britain. 

- The migrants, known as the Windrush Generation after the ship Empire Windrush, faced poor working conditions, harsh weather, and increasing racism/prejudice from white residents in Britain. 

- In response to tensions, Caribbean communities organized events like the Notting Hill Carnival to boost morale and celebrate their culture. Their activism against racism led to the UK's 1965 Race Relations Act banning racial discrimination.

- From the 1960s, UK immigration laws began restricting Commonwealth citizens, ending large-scale Caribbean migration. Over 50 years later, many from the Windrush Generation were wrongly detained, denied rights, or deported due to lost paperwork and the failure to recognize their legal status. 

- Important figures that emerged from the Windrush Generation include Claudia Jones, who organized early Caribbean Carnivals in London to build community, and the founders of the modern Notting Hill Carnival street festival. 

- The 2018 Windrush scandal saw the UK government admit to the "profound institutional failure" that resulted in grave injustices against Windrush migrants and their children. Those affected are being compensated.

 Here is a summary of the provided context:

- In the early 20th century, European settlers in Kenya displaced many indigenous peoples from their fertile lands, especially the Kikuyu people. Despite demands for land reform and representation, the British did not make meaningful changes. 

- Poverty and discontent among the Kikuyu people led to the formation of the radical Kenyan Land and Freedom Army (KLFA), also known as the Mau Mau, in the late 1940s. 

- In 1952, the Mau Mau launched an uprising against British rule in Kenya through guerrilla tactics. The British responded with brutal counterinsurgency operations, detaining thousands of suspected Mau Mau members.

- By the mid-1950s, Britain began granting Kenyans more representation and autonomy in response to international and domestic pressure. Kenya gained independence in 1963 under Jomo Kenyatta.

- The Mau Mau uprising was a significant event in Kenya's independence movement that exposed the injustices of colonial land policies and British oppression, though the Mau Mau veterans were only recently recognized as nationalist heroes in Kenya.

- In the 1950s in Montgomery, Alabama, public transportation was racially segregated by law and Black passengers were sometimes forced to give up their seats for white passengers. 

- On December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks, a Black seamstress, was arrested for refusing to give up her seat for a white passenger on a city bus. Her arrest sparked the Montgomery Bus Boycott.

- Led by the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. and other local Black ministers, the boycott involved Black residents refusing to ride buses in Montgomery for over a year, costing the bus system much revenue. 

- The boycott highlighted the injustice of segregation and drew national attention. It ultimately led to a 1956 Supreme Court ruling declaring Alabama's bus segregation laws unconstitutional.

- The Montgomery Bus Boycott was a key early victory for the civil rights movement. It firmly established Martin Luther King Jr. as a national leader and introduced the concepts of nonviolent protest and civil disobedience to oppose racial injustice.

 

- 1960 was a pivotal year in which 17 African colonies gained independence from European powers. This marked a decisive reversal from centuries of foreign domination on the continent. 

- From the 15th century, Europeans had increased their involvement in Africa through the transatlantic slave trade. In the late 19th century, the major European powers colonized and partitioned the entire continent at the Berlin Conference.

- By the early 20th century, Africa was divided among various European colonial powers into around 50 territories. Nationalist independence movements emerged after World War I, inspired by US President Woodrow Wilson's principles of national self-determination. 

- In the 1950s-60s, as European powers weakened after two world wars, African independence movements intensified through nonviolent protests and political organization. Many colonies achieved independence in 1960, inspired by Ghana's independence in 1957.

- Key newly independent countries in 1960 included 17 former colonies like Somalia, Nigeria, Togo, Madagascar, Benin, Niger, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Chad, Central African Republic, Congo, Gabon, Senegal and Mali, inspiring further decolonization across the continent in subsequent years.

 

The birth of black feminism in the 1960s-70s was a response to the limitations of both mainstream feminism and black power movements in addressing the unique experiences of black women. Mainstream feminism focused on gender equality without acknowledging race-based oppression. Black power movements emphasized black pride and empowerment but reinforced traditional gender roles. Black feminist thinkers like Angela Davis, Audre Lorde and Alice Walker highlighted how black women faced both racial and gender-based discrimination. Walker coined the term "womanism" to describe black feminism. The concept of intersectionality was developed to show how different aspects of identity like race, gender and class interact to shape different oppressions. Black feminist thought challenged patriarchal notions in black power movements and called for racial and gender justice.

 

In 1963, around 250,000 Americans marched in Washington D.C. to proclaim the civil and economic rights of Black Americans. The March on Washington occurred during a period of increasing civil rights activism and violence against Black people across the US. In the lead up to the march, prominent civil rights activists like Medgar Evers had been assassinated. The march aimed to put pressure on the federal government to take stronger actions to end racial discrimination and protect Black citizens. It featured speeches by major civil rights leaders like Martin Luther King Jr., who famously delivered his "I Have a Dream" speech calling for racial equality and justice. The massive, peaceful demonstration highlighted the civil rights movement's goals and mobilized public support, helping to pass landmark civil legislation in 1964 and 1965 that outlawed segregation and racial discrimination. The March on Washington marked a pivotal moment in the struggle for Black equality and human rights in America.

 Here is a summary of the key details:

- In 1963, Nigeria was declared a republic and Dr. Benjamin Nnamdi Azikiwe ("Zik") became its first president. 

- Zik was one of the most prominent African nationalists and statesmen of the 20th century. He had long advocated for Nigerian independence.

- Prior to independence, Zik rose to power through his involvement in Nigerian nationalist politics in the early to mid-20th century. He helped establish several political parties that called for self-government and ultimately independence from British rule. 

- Zik believed that independence was essential for improving Africans' socioeconomic and political development. He wanted Nigeria to be a unified, independent nation.

- As Nigeria's first president in 1963, Zik played a pivotal role in the country's transition from a British colony to an independent republic. However, he faced considerable challenges maintaining unity among Nigeria's various ethnic and religious groups.

So in summary, the passage discusses Zik becoming Nigeria's first president after independence in 1963 and his significance as a nationalist leader who had long fought for Nigerian self-rule and independent nationhood.

 The Black Power movement emerged in the mid-1960s in response to continued systemic racism in the United States despite legal victories of the civil rights movement. It sought to promote Black pride, empowerment, and self-determination through political and cultural means. Politically, groups were influenced by Malcolm X and advocated for Black control of Black communities. Socially, they argued Black culture should be used to promote Black liberation and counter white stereotypes. The movement redifined Black identity and empowered Black Americans. Figures like Malcolm X, Angela Davis, and Black Panther Party advocated fiercely for these goals through various means. The movement had a significant impact on culture through music, art, fashion, and more, promoting the message of Black pride and power.

 Here is a summary of the key points about Malcolm X from the passage:

- Malcolm X became the national spokesperson for the Nation of Islam (NOI) in the late 1950s but split with the organization in 1964. 

- In 1964, he embraced Sunni Islam after making a pilgrimage to Mecca and taking the name El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz. 

- He founded the Organization of Afro-American Unity in 1965 to advocate for black nationalism and empowerment. 

- Some of his most influential works were the 1964 speech "The Ballot or the Bullet" and his 1965 autobiography written with Alex Haley.

Sections Group,

In 1981, tensions between police and the Black community in Brixton, London escalated after a crackdown called Operation Swamp 81 heavily targeted Black people with stop-and-searches. This angered local Black youth and led to violent protests over several days in April, in what became known as the Brixton uprisings. The riots reflected longstanding issues such as disproportionate unemployment rates for Black people, racial profiling by police, and the controversial sus law that allowed stops and searches without cause. 

The uprisings marked a turning point, leading to reforms addressing some of the community's grievances. The sus law was abolished later in 1981 based on campaigns against it. An official inquiry also cited overpolicing as a problem. For the Black community, the riots sparked new activism and political representation. Alex Wheatle's experience in the uprisings influenced his career as a novelist addressing Black British themes. Gradually, more Black and minority ethnic individuals gained positions in UK politics and government over the following decades.

 Here is a summary of the key points about the Rwandan genocide:

- In 1994, around 800,000 people in Rwanda, mainly from the Tutsi minority ethnic group and some Hutu moderates, were killed by Hutu extremists over the span of 100 days. 

- Rwanda had been colonized by Germany and later Belgium, who favored the Tutsi minority and introduced a system of racial identification cards. This exacerbated tensions between the Hutu majority and Tutsi minority. 

- In 1959, the Hutu majority rose up and overthrew the Tutsi monarchy, forcing over 300,000 Tutsis into exile. Many exiled Tutsis formed a rebel group called the Rwandan Patriotic Front. 

- In the early 1990s, the Rwandan government and RPF rebels clashed, and Hutu extremists began spreading propaganda portraying Tutsis as the enemy. This laid the groundwork for the 1994 genocide.

- When the Rwandan president's plane was shot down in 1994, the Hutu extremists took control and launched a campaign of violence across the country targeting the Tutsi population and Hutu moderates. Over 100 days, around 800,000 people were murdered.

 Here are the key points about u refugees after the Rwandan genocide and the election of Barack Obama:

- After the 1994 Rwandan genocide that killed an estimated 800,000 people, mostly Tutsis and moderate Hutus, around 2 million Hutu refugees fled to neighboring countries like Zaire (now Democratic Republic of Congo). This created a massive refugee crisis. 

- Some of the Hutu refugee camps in Zaire were used by Hutu militia groups to launch attacks back into Rwanda, prolonging the conflict. In 1996 the Rwandan government invaded Zaire to pursue these rebel groups.

- Barack Obama was the first Black president of the United States. He was elected in 2008, defeating Republican nominee John McCain. His election was a historic milestone, as he became the first Black head of state in the White House. 

- Obama had experience as a community organizer, civil rights attorney, and lecturer before being elected to the Illinois State Senate in 1996 and later the U.S. Senate in 2004. He ran for president on a platform of political reform, healthcare reform, ending wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and improving the economy.

- His election spurred hopes of progress on issues like racial equality and inspired many. However, he also faced opposition from Republican opponents and right-wing groups during his presidency from 2008 to 2016.

 

In 2013, George Zimmerman was acquitted of murdering Trayvon Martin, spurring the Black Lives Matter movement. Co-founders Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors, and Opal Tometi used #BlackLivesMatter on social media. It mobilized protests against racial injustice. 

Two high-profile deaths in 2014 fueled more protests - Eric Garner was choked to death by police trying to arrest him, and Michael Brown was shot by police in Ferguson, Missouri. Massive protests erupted in Ferguson for weeks. Black Lives Matter organized demonstrations in response. 

The movement drew attention to racism faced by Black communities in the US and other countries like the UK, Germany, and France. It highlighted ongoing issues of discrimination in the criminal justice system and how Black lives were treated as less valuable. The acquittals and deaths showed how little Black lives apparently mattered to authorities. Black Lives Matter became a major social and political movement advocating for racial justice and an end to police brutality.

 

The Black Futures Lab aims to advance policies that strengthen Black communities at the local, state, and federal levels. It encourages legislators and advocacy organizations to do so. Alicia Garza, a co-founder of Black Lives Matter, directs the Black Futures Lab and special projects at the National Domestic Workers Alliance. 

The Black Lives Matter movement began in 2013 in response to the acquittal of George Zimmerman for killing Trayvon Martin. It spread widely in 2014 with protests against police killings of Black individuals such as Michael Brown and Eric Garner. The movement drew international attention with its use of the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag on social media. It also inspired solidarity protests around police violence against Black people in other countries. 

The movement continued gaining momentum through 2016 by raising awareness of numerous deadly incidents involving police. Notable events included Colin Kaepernick kneeling during the national anthem to protest police brutality.

George Floyd's killing in 2020 amid the COVID-19 pandemic triggered the largest BLM protests in history around the world. It increased support for reforms like banning chokeholds, toughening use-of-force standards, and redirecting police funding to social services. The movement also highlighted international issues like disproportionate stop-and-search of Black individuals in the UK. Overall, BLM has brought greater public consciousness to racist injustices and prompted reforms through grassroots organizing.

 

- The African diaspora refers to people of African descent living outside of Africa, estimated at around 170 million people worldwide.

- The countries with the largest African diaspora populations are those that received many enslaved Africans, like the US, Brazil, and Caribbean countries, as well as former colonial powers in Africa like the UK and France. 

- Migration from Africa has both positive and negative effects. While it causes a "brain drain" and loss of skills, remittances sent back provide significant economic benefits. 

- Diaspora communities blended African traditions with local cultures, creating new blended identities and contributing prominently to music, art, language and cuisine in countries like Brazil and parts of the Americas.

- There is a continued sense of connection to an African identity and homeland among diaspora populations, despite geographical dispersion over centuries. Figures from the diaspora also played important roles in African independence movements.
