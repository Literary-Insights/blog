- Building a personal brand leads to more business opportunities, job offers, clients, revenue, and endorsements. It's always early enough to start.

 Here are the critical points on personal branding:

- Define your target audience - who do you want to be known by? Build your brand around their interests.

- Have a clear vision for your future and work backwards from there.

- Focus on improving your strengths rather than just your weaknesses. Become the best at what you're already great at.  

- Be authentic and transparent about your flaws. Your real story connects more with your audience.

- Create a consistent visual style for your brand.

- Growing your brand is about telling your story authentically while you're still writing it. Stay true to your imperfections and flaws. 

- Focus your content efforts on just a few social media channels rather than trying to be on everything. Pick 1-4 channels max.

- Obsess over data, analytics, research to guide your branding decisions. Know your audience and what resonates with them.

- Consistently ask yourself how you can grow and engage your audience. Content should serve your audience.
