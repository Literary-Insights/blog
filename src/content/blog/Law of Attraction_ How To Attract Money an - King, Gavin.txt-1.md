 Here is a summary of the book:

Introduction: The law of attraction is about changing your mindset and behaviors to attract the life you want. It requires action and conviction, not just positive thinking. 

Chapter 1: Making the Decision
- Decide specifically what you want, including the emotional state, actions, and material things. Be detailed.

- Prioritize your desires and goals. Focus on necessities first before wants.
- Write down your decisions and vision in a dream journal.

Chapter 2: Strengthening the Belief
- Believe that what you want is possible. Your thoughts and beliefs shape your reality.
- Use visualization and affirmations to strengthen your belief. Picture having what you want and repeat affirmations.
- Take action, even small steps. Action builds belief and creates momentum. 
- Be flexible in how the universe delivers. Don't be attached to a single path.

Chapter 3: Maintaining a Positive Mindset
- Monitor your thoughts and words. Make sure they align with your vision.
- Deal with doubts and negative thoughts. Don't dwell on them. Replace them with positive ones.
- Practice gratitude. Be grateful for what you have and will receive.

Chapter 4: Attracting Opportunities 
- Put in the work required. Luck comes to those who work hard and persist. 
-Network and connect with others. New opportunities often come through people.
-Look for and notice new opportunities. They may not look like what you expect.
-Take action on opportunities. Do something to get started, even if small.

Chapter 5: Acting on Your Vision
- Continue taking action, especially after initial progress or success. Maintain momentum.
- Review and reset your vision and goals as needed. Make sure they still motivate and inspire you.
- Deal with obstacles and setbacks. Learn from them instead of getting discouraged.
- Celebrate your wins, big and small. Be proud of what you have achieved.

Conclusion: Applying the law of attraction requires ongoing effort and commitment. Continue strengthening your belief, maintaining a positive mindset, attracting new opportunities, and taking action to achieve the life you truly want. Success is a journey, not a destination. Stay dedicated and you will manifest your vision.

 

To strengthen your belief in your vision and goals, you can apply the following techniques:

1. Creative Visualization - Visualizing your ideal outcome in a detailed, multi-sensory way. Do it for at least 5 minutes a day, especially after waking up and before sleeping. 

2. Affirmations - Positively-phrased statements that affirm your belief. Have around 5 affirmations: 1 for your ultimate goal, 2 for short-term goals, 1 for environment, and 1 for a daily task. Recite them daily, especially in the morning. 

3. Conscious Confirmation - Acknowledging events related to your vision as being attracted by the Law of Attraction. Connect positive events to your vision and affirmations. Strengthens your belief and attracts more positive events.

To maintain a positive mindset:

Have a morning and nighttime routine:

Morning:
1. Visualize your desire 
2. Read/recite your affirmations

Night:
1. Visualize your desire
2. Read/recite your affirmations
3. Reflect on related events from the day and be grateful

A positive mindset is key to the Law of Attraction. Staying positive attracts positive outcomes.

 

Before adopting a positive mindset, you need to understand why it is important. Maintaining a positive attitude despite negative circumstances helps counter the effects of those circumstances and keeps you moving towards your goals. The Law of Attraction states that like vibrations attract like things. Positive thoughts have a positive vibration and attract more positive things. Negative thoughts attract negative things. 

To maintain a positive attitude:

1. Stop worrying. Worrying weakens your belief in yourself and attracts negative things. Replace worries with positive visualizations and affirmations.

2. Stop doubting yourself. You are capable of achieving your goals. Don't limit yourself. Give yourself a chance to learn and grow. 

3. Look at the bright side. See the opportunity in negative circumstances. Things are not completely "bad" or "good." There is always a way to turn things in your favor.

4. Remove competition. Do not compare yourself to others or base your success on surpassing them. Set your own standards and work with like-minded people. 

5. Know that nothing is permanent. Do not fear failure. Vibrations are always changing, so failure and success are impermanent. Stay positive and consistent. Failure can lead to later success.

To attract opportunities:

1. Set short-term goals that align with your long-term goals. Achieving short-term goals builds skills and confidence to achieve your ultimate goals. Identify positive opportunities that align with your goals.

2. Use positive speech. Speak in a positive, confident way. Remove negative words and reframe your speech positively. Positive speech strengthens your belief in yourself and attracts opportunities.  

3. Spend time with positive people. Find people with a positive attitude who share your vision and goals. Let them encourage and teach you. Ask them for advice. 

4. Expand your knowledge. Learn as much as possible about your field or goals. The more you know, the more able you are to identify and take advantage of opportunities. Seek out experts and mentors.

5. Take action. Do small things each day that move you closer to your goals. Take opportunities as they arise. Action creates momentum and attracts more opportunities.

 

- Do your research and gain knowledge about the industry you want to excel in. Take formal classes if needed. Success requires knowledge in addition to the right mindset and attitude. 

- Gain hands-on experience. If you want to run a successful shoe business, learn how to make shoes. If you want to be an actor, start acting. Experience attracts opportunities. No one will offer you opportunities if you have no experience or skills to demonstrate.

- Have a plan of action. Set short-term goals to achieve your long-term vision. Make sure you have the necessary skills and resources. If not, plan how to gain them. Set alternatives in case obstacles arise. 

- Make the most of your time. Do not waste time on irrelevant activities. Meet the deadlines and timelines you set for your goals. Ask experts for help if you struggle. 

- Be flexible. Your plans may change. Do not worry as long as your vision is clear and belief is strong. Make adjustments as needed. Think of changes as detours that still lead to your destination.

- Replace bad habits with good ones. Let go of habits that do not serve your goals. Study successful people for good habits to adopt. Try different habits to find what works for you.

- Help others. Helping others achieve their dreams sends positive vibrations and helps you attract good things. What you do for others, you do for yourself. 

- Be grateful. Appreciate what you have. The universe provided it. Expressing gratitude attracts more good things.

In summary, gain knowledge and experience, make a plan, take action by using your time well and replacing bad habits, help others, be flexible, and express gratitude. Monitor your thoughts and words to identify and eliminate self-limiting beliefs. Success is within your control. Apply the principles of the Law of Attraction.

 Here is a summary of the first step to living a life of abundance through the Law of Attraction:

1. Become aware of your negative speech and thoughts. Start monitoring how often you use self-limiting language and negative phrases. Write them down to build awareness. Over time, work to reduce negative speech.

2. Replace negative thoughts with positive ones. When you catch yourself thinking negatively, consciously replace that thought with a positive one. For example, replace "I can't do this" with "I can do this." It will take practice, but you can transform your mindset.

3. Avoid imposing limiting beliefs on others. Don't engage in negative speech that drags other people down or shoots down their dreams. This type of negativity helps no one. 

4. React positively to the success of others. Don't assume others achieved their success through dishonest means. That belief will only hold you back. Instead, look to learn from the success of others. 

5. Know that purging negativity is a lifelong process. Don't beat yourself up over slip-ups. Just renew your commitment to positive thinking and continue moving forward. Maintaining an abundance mindset is a journey.

Those are the key steps to begin living a life of abundance through the Law of Attraction, according to the summary. The overall process involves building awareness around your thoughts and speech, eliminating negativity, maintaining a positive mindset, and learning from the success of others rather than resenting it. With diligent practice, you can achieve an abundance mindset.
