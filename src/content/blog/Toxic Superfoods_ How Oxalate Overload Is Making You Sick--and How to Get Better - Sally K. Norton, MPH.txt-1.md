- Oxalates are natural toxins found in many plants that are commonly consumed as "superfoods" or health foods, like spinach, almonds, turmeric, tea, and chocolate. Consuming high amounts of oxalates can be harmful to health. 

- The author is an oxalate overload survivor who experienced health issues for years before realizing high oxalate intake was the cause. She obtained nutrition degrees but had to learn about oxalates the hard way through personal experience.

- Many people are unaware that their favorite healthy foods may be causing health problems due to high oxalate content. Conditions like digestive issues, pain, low energy, and more could potentially be linked to oxalate overload.

- Trends have caused oxalate intake and related health issues to increase in recent decades. It's risky to follow food trends without understanding their impacts. 

- The book will explain how oxalates cause harm through science, why the connections aren't recognized, the wide range of potential symptoms, and how to properly implement a low-oxalate diet for healing and long-term health. 

- Adopting a low-oxalate diet, when done correctly, can significantly improve quality of life and relieve or even reverse various conditions tied to oxalate overload.

In summary, the introduction outlines the potential harms of oxalates, the author's personal journey, and what topics will be covered to help readers understand and address oxalate overload issues.

 Here are the key points about adopting a low-oxalate diet:

- A low-oxalate diet aims to reduce intake of foods high in oxalate, which can help with oxalate-related health issues like kidney stones. It is not a "no-oxalate" diet. 

- The book provides strategies and resources for following a low-oxalate diet, including identifying high and low oxalate foods, supplement suggestions, and self-assessment quizzes. 

- Benefits of a low-oxalate diet may be seen within the first 2 weeks, as symptoms from oxalate overload can start to improve. However, fully resolving issues may take longer as the body eliminates accumulated oxalates. 

- Adjusting dietary habits to reduce intake of high oxalate foods like potatoes, almonds, spinach is presented as a simple first step. Supportive protocols can help speed recovery.

- Individual results may vary, as everyone's case is unique. Ongoing symptoms during the elimination process are common as the body clears stores of oxalate buildup from long-term diet. 

- Following a low-oxalate diet armed with information in the book can help many identify risks and confidently make healthier dietary choices to improve conditions related to oxalate overload.

 Here is a summary of key points about otic or antifungal medications and long-term use of NSAIDs from the passage:

- Long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen can increase risk of kidney stones by reducing oxalate excretion and impairing kidney function.

- Otic or antifungal medications like clotrimazole can contain high levels of sorbitol, a sugar substitute linked to increased oxalate absorption in the gut. 

- Obesity, diabetes, Crohn's disease, IBS, leaky gut, bariatric surgery, or gut dysbiosis can all disrupt the balance of gut bacteria and increase intestinal oxalate absorption.

- Poor kidney health, history of kidney stones, family history of kidney disease, and frailty or other chronic non-oxalate illnesses can impair the body's ability to clear oxalate through the kidneys.

So in summary, the passage lists several medications and medical conditions that can increase risk of oxalate overload by either reducing oxalate excretion from the body or enhancing intestinal oxalate absorption. Maintaining a low-oxalate diet may help assess and address high oxalate levels in individuals with these risk factors.

 

- Plants contain oxalates in the form of oxalic acid and calcium oxalate crystals as a defensive mechanism against predators and infections. Different shaped crystals like needles and blocks act as weapons to damage tissues when consumed. 

- Oxalate crystals are abrasive and persist through cooking and digestion, potentially harming tissues and cells over time. Pulverizing plants releases more crystals that can irritate the mouth and digestive tract. 

- Oxalates serve various functions for plants like protecting from infections, managing calcium storage, saving carbon, and capturing sunlight. For humans, they provide no benefits and can damage teeth and tissues.

- Consumption of plant foods high in oxalates like kiwi, almonds, nuts and seeds has been linked to kidney damage in some cases. Oxalate crystals from plants like agave can also irritate the skin. 

- Plants use oxalates as a mineral reservoir and structural component. The crystals form protective rings around seeds and tree bark. Germination converts some oxalates to free oxalic acid that is more bioavailable.

 

- Plants often create calcium oxalate crystals as a way to manage and dispose of excess calcium in their cells. Oxalate levels tend to be higher in plants grown in calcium-rich soil. 

- Too much calcium and humidity in tomatoes can lead to gold specks (oxalate crystals), which damage the fruit and cause quicker spoiling.

- Desert plants like cacti use oxalate crystals to store carbon dioxide obtained at night, which they can then use for photosynthesis during the dry daylight hours when their pores are closed. 

- Oxalate levels vary significantly in different foods and even within the same foods, depending on factors like variety, maturity, environment, and cooking method. This makes estimating oxalate intake difficult. 

- Some plant families like brassicas (broccoli, cabbage) and true lettuces tend to be low in oxalates, while seeds, the amaranth family (spinach, beets), and buckwheat family tend to be higher. Nightshades (potatoes, tomatoes) vary more.

- It is easy to overconsume oxalates and experience negative health effects, as studies have shown in animals. Too much can lead to issues like calcium depletion over time. Determining safe intake levels is difficult given the many variables.

 

- Scar tissue cannot revert to normal bone once it has taken over. Similarly, high-oxalate foods can create mineral deficiencies in sheep that are deadly, even though sheep are ruminants that can better tolerate oxalates than horses. 

- A flock of Egyptian sheep died after eating beet greens, a byproduct of sugar beet industry, showing symptoms of calcium and magnesium deficiencies. 

- In humans, high oxalate intake can also disturb calcium metabolism and create deficiencies that harm bones, muscles, nerves, brain and other organs. 

- The safe daily oxalate intake for humans is estimated to be 150-200 mg, while over 250 mg is considered high and over 600 mg is extremely high. However, actual oxalate intake is difficult to determine as food labeling does not require oxalate content.

- It is easy to exceed safe oxalate limits through foods like nuts, chocolate, tea and smoothies containing high-oxalate vegetables like spinach. Two similar daily menus are provided to show how one could have 10 times the oxalate of the other without awareness of oxalate content.

- Even dietitians and nutrition professionals typically have limited understanding of high-oxalate foods and do not consider oxalate toxicity when providing dietary recommendations.

 

- Dark chocolate with almonds contained 87 mg of oxalate. 

- A 12 oz Budweiser beer contained 3 mg of oxalate. 

- The total oxalate for the day on Menu 1 was approximately 1,000 mg. 

- Menu 2 aimed for a total of 100 mg of oxalate per day. The breakdown of oxalate in each meal was:

Breakfast - 12 mg 
Lunch - 20 mg
Dinner - 68 mg

- Common dietary designations include normal oxalate intake being 130-220 mg/day, low oxalate being under 60 mg/day, high oxalate being over 250 mg/day, and extremely high being over 600 mg/day. 

- Foods are designated as low (under 4 mg/serving), moderate (4-9.9 mg/serving), high (over 10 mg/serving) and very high (over 15 mg/serving) in oxalate content.

 

- Popular snacks like chips, nuts, pretzels, and snack bars often contain high levels of oxalates. Chips made from plantains, potatoes, and other vegetables also contain more oxalates than white potato chips. 

- These processed snacks are easy to overeat due to their crunchy texture and carb content. Healthier options like cheese, eggs, or plain yogurt are often demonized for fat/cholesterol content.

- Plant-based milks like almond, soy, rice, and oat milks have replaced dairy milk for many. However, they often contain much higher levels of oxalates than dairy milk and may lack important nutrients. Their processing also makes nutrients less bioavailable. 

- Highly processed plant proteins used in veggie meats, soy formula, and protein powders can be toxic and have poor nutritional value due to processing. But they are seen as healthy alternatives by many consumers.

- A diet high in oxalates and plant compounds that bind nutrients can lead to deficiencies over time due to reduced absorption of minerals like calcium and magnesium. This malnutrition predisposes people to various health issues.

 

- A 1937 study found that feeding spinach to human infants depletes them of calcium and iron. Yet this toxic property of spinach was often dismissed by researchers. 

- Subsequent studies in 1968, 1988, and 1989 further confirmed that the calcium in spinach is poorly absorbed and can decrease absorption of calcium from other foods eaten at the same time. 

- A researcher named Dr. Kohman found that spinach deprived rats of calcium due to its high oxalate content. Greens with low oxalate like kale did not have this effect. 

- Growing children are more susceptible to nutrient deficiencies and toxic exposures from oxalates due to harder time excreting oxalate. 

- Many modern baby foods and diets put emphasis on high-oxalate grains, vegetables like sweet potatoes, carrots, beets which can be a concern. 

- Nutritional analyses do not account for minerals being bound to oxalic acid in plants, so reported nutrient contents do not reflect bioavailability. 

- Oxalate overload creates increased needs for vitamins B6 and B1, contributing to deficiencies. 

- Popular diets like vegetarian, vegan, Paleo, etc. inadvertently promote consumption of high-oxalate foods without awareness of implications. 

- Tables show common modern menus adhering to popular diets contain very high oxalate levels, much more than considered typical/safe amounts.

So in summary, it outlines research on how high oxalate foods like spinach can deprive the body of nutrients, and how modern dietary trends and baby foods emphasize these foods without awareness of oxalate impacts.

 

- The Mediterranean diet is often portrayed as plant-heavy with olive oil and little red meat or saturated fat. But this characterization is based on limited and possibly biased data funded by the olive oil industry. 

- In reality, traditional Mediterranean diets varied significantly between regions and what constitutes a "Mediterranean diet" is undefined. 

- There is less clear evidence that specific features like olive oil provide distinctive health benefits as once thought. Saturated fat is not as toxic as previously believed.

- Modern nutritional advice, like the Mediterranean diet prescription, is driven more by what we want to believe rather than what scientific evidence actually shows works. 

- The health effects of so-called "superfoods" and phytonutrients are not as clear-cut or beneficial as marketing portrays. Some studies have found no benefits or even evidence of harm from high intakes. 

- Constant exposure to plant compounds may cause constant metabolic stress. Some studies found reduced cellular stress and oxidative damage when avoiding many fruits and vegetables. 

- More research is still needed to determine optimal intakes of plants foods and which, if any, phytonutrients meaningfully support long-term health when balanced with potential toxins like oxalate.

In summary, the text questions popular characterizations of the Mediterranean diet and presumed health halo around many plant foods and phytonutrients, noting evidence is often limited or inconsistent regarding benefits. More research is still needed to define health-supporting diets.

 

- Many claims about the benefits of fruits and vegetables may overlook potential harms from compounds like oxalates. Antioxidants in foods may not offset oxalate toxicity. 

- Plants contain toxic compounds like oxalates, tannins, and phytotoxins that can cause issues in large amounts or without proper preparation. Their effects depend on factors like gut bacteria and genetics.

- Fiber is not as beneficial as claimed and may interfere with nutrient absorption or promote overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria. High-fiber diets are not necessary for gut or overall health. 

- Common "health" foods like bran, starfruit, and teas may contain risky compounds like oxalates in concerning amounts that have led to illnesses and deaths in some cases. 

- Cultural biases favor plants as inherently healthy, but evidence suggests limiting intake of certain high-risk plant foods and compounds instead of assuming benefits will outweigh harms for all individuals. A careful, moderate approach is warranted.

 

- A standard banana nut muffin from The Joy of Cooking contains about 21 mg of oxalate per muffin. 

- The Virgin Diet "power" muffin contains over 3 times as much oxalate at 68 mg per muffin. 

- It is possible to make a low-oxalate muffin with only 2 mg of oxalate per muffin using coconut flour, yet providing similar fiber content.

- Eating less bran and relying less on plants may be nutritionally advantageous and better for digestion and the microbiome on a low-oxalate diet.

- While plants are often touted for their health benefits, they also contain antinutrients like oxalates that can cause harm in large amounts. Focusing too much on a plant-centric diet risks oxalate overload.

- People may initially feel better switching to a plant-heavy diet due to reducing toxins, but the benefits are temporary and don't outweigh the long-term risks of toxicity from high oxalate foods. Keeping plant intake moderate is important.

 

- Oxalic acid, also known as oxalates, was first identified and studied in the early 1800s. It was extracted from plants like sorrel and wood sorrel. 

- Oxalates have long been used as an industrial cleaning agent due to their ability to bind with minerals. They are powerful cleaners but also powerful poisons if ingested. 

- In the early 1800s, there were many accidental poisonings when oxalic acid was mistaken for Epsom salts. This led to toxicology studies showing its dangers. 

- Even into the 1830s, oxalates continued to cause public health issues when used as a household cleaner due to its deceptively "salty" name of "salts of lemons." 

- Oxalates are still used today in cleaners like Bar Keepers Friend due to their chelating properties. Prolonged skin contact can cause damage.

- Oxalates from foods like banana peels have potential industrial uses in removing toxic metals from water, though concerns remain about health effects from ingesting oxalates in foods.

So in summary, it outlines the historical context of how oxalates were first identified, their industrial uses as cleaners due to binding minerals, and some of the early public health issues with accidental poisonings when mistaken for salts.

 Here are the various forms that oxalates can take:

- Soluble oxalate salts (potassium or sodium oxalate and oxalic acid) dissolve into very tiny ions that freely move and react within their surroundings. Oxalic acid can exist as either singly or doubly charged ions. 

- Insoluble oxalates (like calcium oxalate) do not easily dissociate, especially at typical body conditions. They can form nanocrystals or microcrystals that accumulate in tissues.

- Oxalate ions readily bind to minerals like calcium and magnesium in the blood, body fluids, or cells. This leads to loss of essential minerals and conversion of minerals into toxins that can damage cells. 

- Over time, accumulating nanocrystals and microcrystals can cause tissue damage and create challenges for the immune system. 

- Oxalates' ability to disrupt cell metabolism through mineral binding has clinical applications, like in glucose testing where potassium oxalate prevents blood cells from using glucose. This points to how frequent mineral binding from oxalates could interfere with cell energy production in the body.

So in summary, oxalates take various soluble and insoluble ionic and crystalline forms depending on their biochemical environment, and this diversity of forms allows them to damage tissues and cells through mineral disruption and crystallization in different ways.

 

- Neurasthenia was a diagnosis in the 19th/early 20th century characterized by depression, anxiety, fatigue, headaches and nerve pain. It was thought to be caused by exhaustion of the nervous system. 

- Oxalate toxicity can cause similar symptoms and may have led to diagnoses of neurasthenia. Liam Hemsworth experienced depression, low energy and kidney stones from a high-oxalate diet.

- In the 1930s, Golding Bird recognized oxalate toxicity as a medical problem causing joint pain, kidney stones, cloudy urine and poor health. He died young from complications of kidney stones. 

- Oxalate toxicity fell out of favor as a diagnosis in mid-20th century. Medicine became more focused on standardized tests and treating diseases at later stages. 

- Today oxalate research focuses only on kidney stones, ignoring other toxic effects. Low-oxalate diets are used only for kidney stones despite proven effectiveness. 

- Multiple fields provide evidence of oxalate toxicity but it is not recognized as a unified problem. Doctors lack tools to diagnose it. 

- Nutrition also overlooks oxalate risks despite statements in their journals about its potential to cause disorders. Early nutrition science focused on cheap efficient diets rather than food safety.

 Based on the passages provided, a profession that significantly influenced American attitudes and eating habits related to diet in the early 1900s was the dietetics profession. Some key details:

- The dietetics profession was founded by Lenna Frances Cooper, a vegetarian who adhered strongly to Adventist beliefs. 

- Cooper authored the founding 1928 dietetic textbook Nutrition in Health and Disease, which became widely used for decades. 

- The profession promoted "New Nutrition" which elevated plant-based foods like grains and beans as essential staples.

- This represented a shift away from consideration of diet as a medical intervention, and promoted public health recommendations like food fortification to address deficiencies. 

- The dietetics profession worked directly with patients and designed therapeutic diets, spreading their plant-centric views of proper nutrition through this work.

So in summary, the emerging dietetics profession in the early 1900s, founded by a prominent vegetarian, helped change American attitudes and popularize more plant-based eating through their educational activities and clinical work with patients.

 Here are the main points:

- Certain foods and supplements contain oxalate, which can be absorbed into the bloodstream and deposited as crystals in tissues. Even in the absence of medical conditions, a high-oxalate diet alone can lead to oxalate toxicity. 

- Common foods that are high in oxalate include spinach, rhubarb, beet greens, nuts, certain fruits like strawberries. Supplements like vitamin C can also contain oxalate.

- Hanna's story illustrates how a long-term vegetarian, high-oxalate diet led to recurrent kidney stones and other health issues, despite normal medical tests. Adopting a low-oxalate diet improved her symptoms.

- Testing for oxalate levels in urine and blood is unreliable and often gives normal or false negative results. Oxalate handling occurs in cycles and excretion can lag intake by weeks or months. Tissue biopsies also have limitations. 

- Common signs of potential oxalate overload include recurrent kidney stones, urinary issues, joint/muscle pain, unexplained fatigue. A combination of these signs should raise suspicion even with normal test results. Response to a low-oxalate diet can help determine if oxalates are a contributing factor.

 Here is a summary of key points about factors that can aggravate oxalate overload:

- Diet is the primary source of oxalate, contributing an estimated 50% or more of the body's oxalate load. 

- Endogenous (metabolic) oxalate production occurs in the liver and other tissues, contributing around 12 mg per day. This is influenced by nutrient deficiencies, toxicity, and chronic inflammation/metabolic stress. 

- Metabolic oxalate comes from the breakdown of vitamin C (around 10 mg) and other compounds like glycine that convert to oxalate. 

- Common modern dietary patterns like excessive processed seed oils, sugar/starch, and calories promote chronic metabolic stress, inflammation, and higher oxalate production. 

- Vegetarian diets relying on grains, beans, starchy vegetables can cause nutrient deficiencies, low muscle mass, weak bones, and metabolic issues like high blood sugar/insulin that aggravate oxalate handling. 

- Environmental and lifestyle factors that influence genetic expression (epigenetics) also impact one's ability to deal with oxalate load. Diet, stress, toxins can make the body more susceptible to the effects of oxalates.

 

- Oxalate overload illness can manifest differently in individuals based on factors like genetics, sex, age, medications, lifestyle, diet, and toxic exposures. 

- In addition to dietary oxalate, other sources like consumer products, pollution, and drinking water can contribute toxic stress. 

- Excess oxalate intake can lead to a vicious cycle where it causes deficiencies, inflammation and liver stress, increasing oxalate production and worsening the toxic effects. 

- Even organic, plant-based diets may not protect against toxins if high in oxalates, as liver function is impacted. A case study showed breast milk contamination despite a "clean" diet.

- Vitamin C supplements over 1g/day and collagen supplements over 1 tbsp/day can increase oxalate production. Protein intake alone does not but high carb diets are associated with metabolic stresses intensifying oxalate toxicity. 

- Absorption of dietary oxalate influences the severity and speed of high-oxalate diet sickness. Food is the #1 source of oxalate in the body.

 

- Oxalate is naturally present in many foods but is mostly not absorbed by the body. Absorption rates are estimated to be 10-15% on average. Even 10% absorption can have health impacts given high oxalate intakes. 

- Hyperabsorption, when more than 15% is absorbed, can occur in people. Absorption as high as 72% has been observed in some individuals. Factors like gastrointestinal inflammation can increase absorption rates.

- Conditions like obesity, metabolic syndrome, and bariatric surgery increase vulnerability to oxalates due to poor nutritional status and gut dysfunction. High oxalate diets after such procedures can lead to permanent kidney damage. 

- NSAIDs like ibuprofen also increase vulnerability by damaging the gut and kidneys, allowing more oxalate absorption. Up to 70% of NSAID users may experience issues like gut inflammation and permeability.

- Gut health directly impacts oxalate absorption. Inflammation and lack of nutrients increase absorption by widening spaces between cells and reducing oxalate transporters. 

- Absorbed oxalate circulates through the body and organs before reaching the kidneys, which try to excrete it. Frequent high oxalate meals can overwhelm kidney clearance capacity.

- The bacterium Oxalobacter helps break down oxalate in the gut but is often absent in people, worsening their ability to manage oxalate intake and absorption.

 

- Oxalobacter bacteria in the gut help break down oxalate from foods. However, most oxalate absorption occurs in the upper GI tract where bacteria levels are low, so these bacteria cannot fully prevent oxalate absorption.

- Having oxalate-eating bacteria in the colon will not protect tissues in the digestive tract or other areas from the abrasive effects of oxalate crystals from food. 

- The notion that Oxalobacter allows unlimited intake of high-oxalate foods like spinach is a misconception. Dietary oxalate intake still needs to be moderated.

- When oxalate intake exceeds the body's ability to excrete it, the excess oxalate accumulates in tissues over time and can lead to health issues via three main mechanisms: structural compromise, ongoing exposure even after diet changes, and immune system activation promoting inflammation.

- Studies in rats have shown oxalate accumulates in various tissues even when kidney function is normal, supporting that accumulation occurs throughout the body, not just the kidneys. Both trigger doses and low/moderate long-term intake can promote accumulation.

So in summary, while gut bacteria may help with oxalate, dietary intake still needs control to prevent oxalate accumulation in tissues and potential health consequences over time.

 

- Studies found that increasing oxalate intake from food can significantly increase oxalate absorption and excretion levels. Even moderate, daily oxalate intake can lead to issues if combined with trigger levels from occasional high-oxalate meals. 

- Oxalate deposits are very difficult to detect through standard medical imaging and tissue examination due to their small size and scattered distribution. They can be overlooked even when directly examining tissues under microscopy.

- Oxalate crystals have been found in many tissues throughout the body, including blood vessels, eyes, glands, bones, joint spaces, etc. This suggests oxalate accumulation may be more common than recognized.

- Susceptibility to oxalate accumulation varies and is influenced by tissue health, nutrient status, injury/inflammation, oxygen levels, pH, antioxidant levels. Initial deposits can grow larger in damaged or weakened tissues that cannot contain the crystals. Even minor daily wear and tear may promote accumulation in those with high oxalate levels.

 

The eventual appearance of symptoms or non-resolving injury can occur due to crystal accumulation from oxalate in the diet under stressful conditions like injury, surgery, pregnancy, or physically demanding jobs. Accumulation is also more likely with genetic or age-related increased health risks, obesity, high blood sugar, or metabolic stress. 

Certain tissues like the kidneys, liver, gut, brain, ears, testes, pancreas, thyroid and salivary glands have membrane transporters that move oxalate in and out of cells as part of their regular functions. This can lead to oxalate-related stress and accumulation over time.

When accumulation reaches a certain threshold, it triggers inflammation as crystals act as irritants. This prolonged inflammation can prevent proper healing and increase infection risk. The immune system forms containment structures called granulomas around crystals, but these remainsites of potential future activation if crystals are not degraded. Symptoms may remain latent until reserves are depleted.

 

- Chronic acidity from factors like high oxalates leads to thinning bones (osteopenia and osteoporosis) by hindering bone maintenance. 

- Damaged mitochondria are implicated in many health issues by causing insufficient energy production. This can trigger stress-related symptoms and metabolic problems. Nerve and immune cell distress specifically contributes to various neurological and inflammatory symptoms. 

- Low energy impairs the immune system and other defense mechanisms, making chronic infections more likely. Oxalates also directly injure immune cells.

- Oxalates activate chronic immune responses that perpetuate cellular damage and metabolic stress long-term. This can predispose people to autoimmune diseases over time. 

- The body employs proteins like osteopontin to help cope with oxalate overload, but this can paradoxically promote inflammation, tissue damage, and disease progression. 

- Fibrosis results from tissue injury but becomes problematic when high oxalates inhibit normal cellular repair and replacement, allowing excessive scar tissue to accumulate and impair organ function. 

- Overall, high levels of oxalate crystals overwork the immune system and mitochondria, undermine cellular energy production, impair repair processes, and promote chronic low-grade inflammation and damage - contributing to many health problems.

 

- Oxalate is a powerful activator of mast cells. Mast cells play roles in the immune system and help nerves and the immune system communicate. 

- When activated, mast cells secrete chemicals like histamine that can cause symptoms like rashes, asthma attacks, muscle spasms, numbness/tingling, and pain. A variety of conditions are associated with mast cell activation.

- Oxalate overload can cause mast cell activation symptoms in patients. There is no cure for overactive mast cells, so avoiding triggers like oxalate is important. 

- Oxalate buildup may also trigger the shedding of living epithelial cells, which are seen in conditions affecting the kidneys. High oxalate levels can damage cells in tissues throughout the body.

 

The gut is an organ that regulates bodily health by sensing the environment and communicating information to the body and mind so they can respond appropriately. Damage to immune, nerve, or hormonal cells in the gut can have ripple effects elsewhere. 

Oxalate can damage the digestive tract and gut bacteria, causing increased permeability ("leaky gut") and dysbiosis. It has long been associated with gut inflammation and dysfunction. Oxalate poisoning shows symptoms of stomach, digestive, and nervous system problems. Studies link oxalate to issues like abdominal pain, kidney stones, and inflammatory bowel diseases.

The passage details one woman's story. For 13 years she suffered from fecal incontinence, abdominal pain, and other digestive issues. Tests found gallstones, kidney crystals, and calcium deposits. A low-oxalate diet resolved her problems rapidly. This suggests her issues were from oxalate's toxic effects on nerves and muscles controlling bowel function.

Oxalate can also damage nerves, brain, muscles, blood vessels, and cause pain issues. It is a neurotoxin that can lead to problems like anxiety, depression, migraines, and cognitive deficits. It disrupts ions important for cell function. It triggers inflammation that causes transient pain episodes. It damages blood vessels and contributes to conditions like hypertension, atherosclerosis, and cardiovascular diseases. In summary, oxalate overload can damage multiple body systems and cause a wide range of health problems.

 

- Oxalate can cause vascular calcification and hypertension by disturbing calcium metabolism in vascular smooth muscle cells. This causes them to behave like bone cells and mineralize blood vessels. 

- Inflammation from damaged vessels leads to more oxalate and calcium deposits, increasing crystal deposition in both vessels and surrounding tissues. This worsens inflammation.

- High oxalate levels are associated with cardiovascular disease like fibrosis and high blood pressure. 

- Oxalate deposits can obstruct blood flow and cause purplish skin discoloration in patients with severe hyperoxaluria. 

- Oxalate overload raises risks of arrhythmias, heart block, and heart attacks by damaging heart tissue and disrupting electrolytes. 

- It is also linked to musculoskeletal problems like muscle damage, joint damage/arthritis, brittle bones prone to fracture, sensitive teeth, and hearing issues.

- Other potential effects include anemia, kidney problems, and issues in the urinary system like bladder pain and chronic pelvic pain.

 Here is a summary of key points about oxalate clearing and urinary urgency:

- Oxalate crystals can accumulate in tissues over time from dietary oxalates. Removing oxalates from the diet starts a clearing process to remove these crystals from the body. 

- Clearing involves immune cells, inflammation, and the breakdown and excretion of oxalate deposits. This can temporarily increase oxalate levels in the blood and tissues.

- Clearing symptoms can range from mild to severe and involve various parts of the body like the heart, bladder, joints, etc. Examples include insomnia, electrolyte imbalances, palpitations, fatigue.

- Symptoms tend to come in waves as the body works to clear oxalates over months or years. They can occur or worsen after dietary changes or during periods of increased clearing activity. 

- Urinary urgency is listed as a potential clearing symptom as the bladder tries to remove excess oxalates. 

- The clearing process reflects the body's effort to undo years of oxalate accumulation. It takes time and can involve ups and downs as the toxic load decreases gradually. Managing intake and supporting the body can help optimize clearing.

 

- The person has returned to an ancestral/low-oxalate diet and initially felt good, but now is experiencing some negative symptoms. 

- Symptoms include eyes feeling crunchy/grainy, headaches, jaw tension, and fatigue. They recognize this as "oxalate dumping" from the diet change. 

- The dumping is affecting their bowel movements and blood circulation. They feel awful physically but have more energy and feel cleaner overall. 

- They acknowledge this "oxalate clearing" process is difficult but they are still enjoying the diet for the improved energy and clean feeling.

- The post discusses how clearing oxalates from the body can paradoxically cause temporary worsening of symptoms as oxalates are redistributed and removed from tissues. This is a normal part of the healing process from long-term high oxalate intake. 

- It's important not to interpret clearing symptoms as the diet not working and revert to a high oxalate diet, as that would halt the healing. The clearing shows the diet is having the intended effect of removing oxalates stored in the body.

So in summary, the person is experiencing common temporary worsening of symptoms due to oxalate clearing from their diet change, but recognizes this is a normal part of the healing process and is sticking with the low-oxalate diet.

 

- Determining if oxalate overload is the cause of someone's health issues can be difficult, as symptoms are often variable, delayed, and change over time. Other factors like medication, malnutrition or infections can also contribute to symptoms. 

- Even if oxalates are not the original cause of illness, they may still play a role in preventing recovery by worsening existing symptoms. Reducing oxalate intake through diet changes may improve symptoms but not completely eliminate them or provide immediate relief. 

- Helen's story illustrates how following a low-oxalate diet revealed positive effects for her health issues like weight loss, reduced pain and improved digestion/cravings. It took about a month for relief of symptoms.

- Trying a low-oxalate diet yourself for 3 months is recommended to see if it helps determine if oxalates are contributing to your health problems. Consistency is important. 

- An "oxalate challenge test" of reintroducing higher oxalate foods after 3 months can help further confirm if oxalates are an issue, as it may cause symptoms to return. This needs to be done intentionally to learn from any effects.

 

- The passage recommends taking a phased transition approach to adopting a low-oxalate diet. This includes two phases - the first phase involves gradually lowering oxalate intake to moderate or normal levels, then pausing. The second phase involves more carefully moving to a truly low-oxalate diet. 

- It's important to go slow, be deliberate, and keep it simple. Don't make abrupt changes or jump on and off the diet. Be consistent and persistent over the long term. 

- An example is given of Ron, who gradually lowered his intake over a year by modifying his snacks. This allowed a safe transition without difficulties. 

- Different "zones" of oxalate intake are outlined - dangerously high, triggering deposits, maintaining deposits, and homeostasis. The goal is to move from the high zones to the lower zones over time through consistent reduction.

- Going too low in oxalates too quickly can overwork the body's excretion systems and potentially cause issues like kidney stones. A gradual, phased approach is recommended.

 

- Phase One aims to stop accumulations from growing by moving intake from the "Danger zone" (over 250 mg oxalate per day) down to the "Maintenance zone" (150-200 mg per day). This allows tissue and kidney healing to begin while avoiding significant clearing. 

- Phase Two aims to clear existing accumulations by gradually lowering intake from the Maintenance zone toward the "Remove zone" (under 100 mg per day). This induces controlled clearing of deposits at a tolerable pace. 

- It's best to make the transition between phases gradually over weeks or months to give the body time to adjust. Moving too quickly can trigger uncomfortable clearing symptoms.

- Consistency is important - avoid fluctuations above and below the target intake levels, as this can disrupt the clearing process. Occasional mild trigger doses may help curb clearing symptoms in some cases. 

- Listen to your body and adjust the targets as needed based on your individual response. Clearing can take years, so patience is important. The goal is finding a sustainable low-intake "sweet spot."

 

- The passage describes how people may develop a new sensitivity or reactivity to high-oxalate foods after adopting a low-oxalate diet for some time. 

- There are four reasons provided for this: 1) Increased awareness allows them to recognize the connection between foods and body reactions. 2) Absorption of oxalate may be slightly higher when the body is accustomed to low levels. 3) The body is working at full capacity to remove oxalate. 4) The immune system may be primed to respond strongly to oxalate crystals. 

- It advises paying attention to ups and downs in health as the body continues clearing oxalate deposits, which can take years. Sticking to the low-oxalate diet and returning to it if straying is recommended.

- Tables are provided comparing the worst high-oxalate offenders to safer low-oxalate options to help in converting to a new diet while limiting or removing problematic foods and filling the diet with tested safer choices.

 

- Provides lists of foods categorized as extremely high, high, and medium-low oxalate levels. Foods higher in oxalate should be limited or replaced. 

- Suggests ways to replace extremely high oxalate foods in Phase 1 with moderate oxalate foods in smaller portions. Gives examples like replacing a spinach salad with a mixed greens salad containing less spinach.

- Discusses portion sizes being important when including foods with 20-50mg oxalates in Phase 1 to help reduce oxalates gradually without excess clearing symptoms. 

- Presents sample meal plans (Whole Foods, Pescatarian, Paleo diets) and how to modify them between a high oxalate baseline, Phase 1 with a daily intake of 150mg oxalates, and Phase 2 under 60mg daily. 

- Emphasizes becoming familiar with oxalate contents of foods through references, awareness of ingredients in prepared/restaurant foods, and paying attention to how individual foods make you feel.

 Here is a summary of a Paleo diet that avoids all grains, legumes, and most dairy foods but allows meat:

- The Paleo diet avoids all grains such as wheat, barley, rye, oats, and corn. It also avoids legumes such as beans, peas, and lentils.

- Most dairy is avoided on the Paleo diet, with the exception of some cheeses, butter, and ghee. Milk, cream, Greek yogurt are generally not allowed. 

- The diet focuses on meat, including beef, pork, lamb, game meats like venison and bison. Poultry like chicken and turkey are also allowed.

- Fish and seafood of all kinds are included in the Paleo diet.

- Eggs are a good source of protein.

- Fruits and vegetables are emphasized, with the exception of starchy tubers like potatoes.

- Nuts and seeds are allowed in moderation. 

- Oils like olive oil, coconut oil, avocado oil are used for cooking and dressing foods.

So in summary, the Paleo diet avoids grains, legumes, and most dairy, but centers around meat, fish, eggs, fruits, vegetables, nuts and oils for a grain-free and mostly dairy-free whole foods approach. Meat serves as a major protein source.

 

- Fats and oils do not contain oxalate, as the oxalate sinks and gets filtered out during oil preparation. So using peanut or sesame oil in cooking is safe from an oxalate perspective. 

- Extracts can be used to enhance flavors in cooking and baking while being low in oxalates. Examples given are curcumin and olive leaf extract. 

- Refined starches like potato and corn starch contain little to no oxalate and can be used as thickeners. But not all powdered starches are refined, so the packaging needs to be checked. Arrowroot and tapioca starch contain oxalates.

- Spice amounts matter - they can significantly contribute to oxalate intake if used in large quantities. Common high-oxalate spices are turmeric, cumin, black pepper, parsley and basil. 

- Wheat products vary in oxalate content but can deliver meaningful amounts overall. Breads, pastas, cereals are discussed. Gluten-free substitutes also vary. 

- Cooking methods can impact oxalate - boiling helps leach some out, soaking and fermenting generally do not lower levels significantly.

 

- Kombucha is lower in oxalates than regular tea, containing 4-9 mg per cup compared to an estimated 25-40 mg per cup of tea. Kombucha's fermentation process reduces the oxalate content. 

- The next sections provide steps and action items for assessing one's oxalate intake, planning to reduce intake, transitioning to a lower oxalate diet gradually, supporting the body's recovery over time rather than rushing changes, and maintaining an awareness of one's relationship with food. 

- Specific suggestions are given for reducing intake of "worst offender" high oxalate foods, using low and medium oxalate foods for nutrition, portion control, tracking progress, and avoiding too rapid of changes. 

- Supporting one's recovery through lifestyle modifications like rest, stress reduction, toxin avoidance, and thermal therapies like sauna and cold exposure is recommended. 

- The chapter then goes into more details on supplement recommendations and how needs may change as the body's status improves with diet modifications. Adaptability over time is emphasized.

 Here is a summary of the key points about saunas, cold therapy, sunlight exposure, and supplements from the passage:

- Saunas can have health benefits similar to exercise by improving circulation, blood pressure, weight loss, etc. They may be preferable for oxalate clearing if one lacks energy for intense exercise. Dry saunas are 160-200°F while infrared saunas are lower at 100-160°F. 

- Cold showers of 3 minutes provide mood benefits and pain relief. Cold therapy after sauna is restorative. Guidelines include using coldest water for 3 minutes without hitting head. 

- Sunlight exposure is important for vitamin D and cardiovascular health. Exposure of arms and face for 15-20 minutes per day is recommended, gradually increasing tolerance. Outdoor exposure is best but vitamin D lamps can supplement in winter. 

- Supplements are needed to correct deficiencies from oxalate overload and facilitate safe oxalate clearing. Key supplements mentioned are calcium, minerals, and nutrients to support metabolic pathways and reduce symptoms from clearing. Supplementation should be personalized and adjusted based on individual needs and responses.

 

- Finding the right supplements and doses for your individual needs takes time, patience, and listening to your body's responses. Effects may vary each time you try something. 

- The suggested supplements are generally safe, but you may experience unpleasant reactions as your body adjusts or as supplements encourage oxalate release from tissues. Starting low and increasing gradually is recommended. 

- Responses can change over time, so it's important to experiment and find what works best for you. Don't be afraid to revisit something that didn't work initially. 

- High supplement intake can potentially speed oxalate release, causing more severe symptoms. If this happens, consider taking a break or lowering doses until symptoms subside. 

- For some people, ongoing higher doses of certain supplements like B vitamins and minerals are needed to support normal functioning due to changes in metabolic pathways from oxalate toxicity. 

- Key minerals suggested are calcium, magnesium, potassium, and trace minerals. Minerals are important co-factors but can also exacerbate symptoms if doses are increased too quickly. 

- Calcium in particular is recommended to help bind and remove oxalate from the body. Doses of 1,000-1,600 mg per day split into multiple doses are generally suggested. 

- It's best to take calcium supplements without additional vitamin D to maximize benefits and oxalate removal in the colon. Vitamin D can be taken separately if needed.

 Here is a summary of the key points on need for magnesium, potassium, and sodium/salt based on the provided text:

- Magnesium is important for cellular energy, thiamine metabolism, and helping oxalate exit the body without crystallizing. Low magnesium can contribute to headaches, migraines, and depression. Starting magnesium supplementation at 200 mg and increasing up to 600 mg per day is recommended. 

- Potassium is also important for oxalate clearing and cellular function. The RDA is 4,700 mg but many women get only around 2,300 mg. Potassium has benefits like improving muscle function and lowering blood pressure. Starting supplementation at 800 mg per day and increasing to 2,500 mg is suggested. 

- Sodium, in concert with other electrolytes like potassium, helps maintain cellular energy processes. Too little sodium can cause issues like low blood sugar and lethargy. Sodium needs to be matched with potassium intake to maintain good balance. Salt is the main dietary source of sodium and mineral salts like Redmond Real Salt are recommended.

In summary, adequate magnesium, potassium, and sodium are important for cellular function, oxalate excretion, muscle health, blood sugar control and more based on the information provided. Supplementation is suggested within the outlined dosing guidelines.

 

- Mineral salts like Himalayan pink salt are recommended over table salt as they contain important minerals like iodine and are less processed. 

- It is suggested to begin salting foods to taste with mineral salt and to supplement with at least 1/2 teaspoon per day in water or electrolyte drinks containing potassium. The amount can gradually increase up to 2 teaspoons per day. 

- Supplementing with salt can improve hydration, circulation, exercise tolerance, brain function, stress tolerance, heat tolerance, fatigue, joint pain and lower cravings for sweets. 

- An electrolyte drink recipe called "Salty Sports Drink" is provided that contains salt, potassium, magnesium and trace minerals. 

- Other minerals discussed that may support health include sulfur (from foods and supplements like MSM), silicon (for connective tissue), and a trace mineral complex.

- It is recommended to drink purified water with added minerals rather than tap water due to potential toxins, and filters only remove some contaminants while bottled water also has issues.

 

- Reverse osmosis water filtration removes most contaminants but also minerals that are important for health. Some RO systems add back calcium or magnesium.

- Purified water can be improved by adding back trace minerals like potassium, along with potassium bicarbonate and citrate powders. This makes the water more alkaline and nutritious. 

- Soaking in mineral-rich baths allows absorption of minerals through the skin, which can help with conditions like oxalate overload. Recipes are provided for mineral bath formulas.

- Citric acid and citrate help dissolve calcium oxalate crystals in the urine and kidneys. Taking lemon juice or citrate supplements increases citrate in the urine and makes it more alkaline. This treatment can help reduce kidney stones and symptoms.

- Lemon juice specifically is a good source of citric acid and citrate. Consuming at least two lemons per day can help address acidosis and oxalate issues. A recipe is provided for an alkalizing lemon drink.

- Various citrate supplements like potassium citrate are effective for treating and preventing kidney stones by alkalizing the body and urine and increasing protective citrate levels.

 

- Hydroxycitrate is a lesser-known citrate that may be effective for kidney stone prevention and has alkalizing properties. However, clinical studies on its safety and efficacy are limited. It is available OTC but has some safety concerns if taken without medical supervision, especially for those with liver issues. 

- For those who don't tolerate citrate, alternatives include sodium or potassium bicarbonate taken in small amounts daily, which have alkalizing effects. Coconut water is another option.

- If citrate supplements don't agree, the low oxalate diet can still be effective. Mineral supplements are also available without citrate. 

- Key vitamins to support the low oxalate diet and address toxicity include B vitamins like thiamine, biotin, and vitamin B6 (pyridoxal-5'-phosphate), as well as vitamin C and D. B vitamin deficiencies can increase oxalate levels and alleviate deficiencies takes consistent supplementation over months. Forms like benfotiamine and lipothiamine may be better absorbed. 

- Thiamine and vitamin B6 specifically play important roles in energy metabolism and restricting oxalate synthesis. Deficiencies are common and correcting them takes time and high quality supplements.

 Here is a summary of the key points about vitamin supplements from the passage:

- Biotin (vitamin B7) supplements of 5-10 mg per day can help reduce side effects from dumping oxalate like brain fog. Higher doses of up to 100-200 mg may be needed when clearing symptoms are heavy. 

- Vitamin B6 works best in its active form P-5-P rather than pyridoxine. Doses of 15-100 mg per day split into two doses can help limit internal oxalate production and address deficiencies. 

- Thiamine supplements like benfotiamine, sulbutiamine, lipothiamine, and allithiamine can assist with energy metabolism and neurological function as subclinical deficiencies are common. Doses should be adjusted based on individual response.

- A multivitamin is generally recommended but it's important it contains the bioactive forms of vitamins. Individual nutrient needs may change with oxalate levels so monitoring response is important. 

- Vitamin C intake should be limited to 250 mg or less from supplements to avoid raising oxalate levels. Modest supplemental doses of 50-100 mg may be taken when feeling ill.

- Probiotics are generally not effective at reducing oxalate levels as gut bacteria cannot usually be reestablished through supplements. Antioxidants are also not recommended for routine daily use.

- NSAID painkillers should be avoided as they are ineffective for oxalate-related pain and may worsen inflammation and gut health. Natural anti-inflammatories are preferable.

 

- Pain medications have a place in palliative care and short-term acute situations, but it's important to be aware of their dangers and downsides. For oxalate overload, less harmful techniques like hot compresses, sauna, and diet are preferable for pain management. 

- Key supports for recovery from oxalate overload include lifestyle changes, mineral supplements, citrates, B vitamins, and avoiding certain things like probiotics, prolonged antioxidants, and painkillers. 

- Lifestyle changes involve rest, limiting toxins, heat/cold therapies, vitamin D, and pain management. Mineral supplements provide calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, sulfur, and trace minerals. Citrates support kidney function and crystal removal. B vitamins support metabolism. 

- Probiotics, prolonged antioxidants, and painkillers are things to avoid during recovery. Overall the approach emphasizes natural techniques and nutrient support over medication whenever possible for healing from oxalate overload.

 

- Adopting a low-oxalate diet requires honesty, carefulness and thoroughness. Have patience and faith that your body will heal with proper nutrition, rest and reducing your toxic burden over time. 

- Trust that your consistent daily actions, like following the low-oxalate diet, are improving your health even if you have doubts. Hand over worries to your higher power and trust your biology.

- It takes time to heal physically and psychologically from what you have endured. Be kind to yourself through feelings of uncertainty during your healing journey. 

- Changing behaviors and beliefs can be difficult, especially under stress. Be patient with yourself and don't strive for perfection. Work on emotional honesty and understanding what drives emotional eating patterns. 

- Maintain inner peace and calm through mindfulness, relaxation activities and enjoying moderate physical activity. Focus on self-care daily. Growth comes through facing challenges on the healing path.

- Following the diet requires patience, mindfulness and self-compassion, especially when appetite shifts occur. Trust your body is working to heal itself with proper nourishment and rest. 

- Share your experiences to help others, as the most powerful truth comes from one's own healed body. Maintaining health requires consistent daily actions over the long term.

- Common sources of plant-based protein and calorie energy that are lower in irritants include tomatoes, eggplant, chocolate, peanuts, soy.

- Websites and books are listed as resources for more information on low oxalate diets and the potential role of oxalates in health conditions.

 Here is a summary of the paper:

The paper by Kotaro Konno, Takashi A. Inoue, and Masatoshi Nakamura studies the defensive functions of raphides (calcium oxalate crystals) and proteases in plants through a "needle effect." They find that raphides from leaves of Dieffenbachia injure animal tissues through physical damage from the needle-like crystals. Proteases are also released from the plant tissues after damage, which cause additional harm. Together, raphides and proteases form a synergistic defensive system for the plant through a "needle effect" that first physically damages tissues and then degrades them enzymatically. The crystals are involuntary inclusions formed in the vacuoles of plant cells that act as efficient defenses against herbivores and pathogens. The study provides insights into how plants have evolved multipronged defensive strategies using phytochemicals like crystals and enzymes.

 Here is a summary of the key points about antinutritional and toxic compounds in many foods:

- Lectins are proteins found in many foods that can inhibit nutrient absorption and have other antinutritional effects if consumed in large quantities. Common foods containing lectins include legumes, grains, nightshades, and nuts. 

- Tannins are polyphenol compounds that can bind iron and other minerals, inhibiting their absorption. They are commonly found in tea, coffee, wine, and nuts.

- Theobromine is a stimulant alkaloid found in chocolate that can be toxic at high doses, especially for pets and small children. 

- Oxalates are compounds found in spinach, rhubarb, and other foods that can interfere with calcium and iron absorption. High oxalate intake has been linked to kidney stone formation. 

- Curcumin, a compound in turmeric, is poorly absorbed by the body. High doses could theoretically cause harm, though clinical evidence is still lacking. Absorption is increased when taken with black pepper.

- Claims that antioxidant supplements or very high intakes of fruits and vegetables are beneficial are questionable. Some studies have found potential harmful effects from antioxidant supplements. More research is still needed.

 Here is a summary of the key points about oxalate and urinary stone disease from the sources provided:

- In the mid-1800s, physicians like James Begbie and H. Wilson investigated the relationship between rhubarb consumption and "oxalate of lime" (calcium oxalate) in the urine, noting its potential to cause urinary stones. 

- By the 1850s, Golding Bird's work brought more attention to calcium oxalate deposits in the urine and their diagnostic and therapeutic implications.

- In England in the 1800s, rhubarb was a popular seasonal food that was noted to increase oxalate excretion in the urine and potentially cause stones.

- By the 1930s, the collection of symptoms was referred to as the "oxalic acid syndrome".

- Many patients with oxalate stones were described as nervous or neurasthenic. High oxalate was thought to potentially exhaust the nervous system.

- The 1910 Flexner Report reformulated medical education in the U.S., moving attention away from specialized conditions like oxalate stones. 

- Interest has renewed since the 1980s, with numerous conferences held on oxalate and kidney stone disease.

- Oxalate is now recognized as a critical contributor to recurrent calcium kidney stones, though its role is complex and variable between individuals. Precision diagnosis and management targeting oxalate remain areas of active research.

 This note summarizes several references provided for additional context on topics related to oxalate and its effects on the body:

- The journal article analyzes calcium and oxalate levels in the urine of nearly 4,000 women. 

- The book chapter describes following 13 volunteers in the UK over a full year to study seasonal variations in urine composition. 

- Several journal articles argue that you'd need nine 24-hour urinalyses to adequately evaluate nephrolithiasis and variability between collections.

- One article finds a relationship between protein intake and urinary oxalate/glycolate excretion. 

- The cookbook notes that averages are not useful for identifying oxalate-related problems. 

- An article describes the mechanism of crystal-induced kidney injury from nepaluithiasis. 

- One article reports a case where the liver acted as a "selective sponge" retaining oxalates after bilateral nephrectomy. 

- Another article describes a case where a patient's serum oxalate was undetectable but plasma measurement was not diagnostic. 

- Several sources outline clinical indicators of oxalate overload.

- An autopsy study and case report provide information on effects of high oxalate loads. 

- One article examines the toxicity of xylitol infusions.

- Several sources detail the various organ complications that can occur in primary hyperoxaluria. 

- Articles describe how primary hyperoxaluria can produce diverse, confusing symptoms. 

- A case report outlines acute renal failure from oxalic acid poisoning. 

- Research using ethylene glycol to induce oxalate toxicity in rats is noted. 

- Neurological sequelae have been reported despite normal CT scans following ethylene glycol poisoning.

 Here is a summary of the article "When a Single Cause Is Not Crystal Clear," American Journal of Kidney Diseases:

This article discusses the challenges of determining the single cause of kidney stone formation in some patients. Kidney stones often have complex etiologies with multiple contributing factors. While some stones are clearly caused by genetic defects in specific metabolic pathways, many stones result from complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors. 

Determining the precise cause can be difficult, as pathways regulating oxalate and calcium homeostasis involve multiple genes and environmental influences like diet. Genome-wide association studies have identified several genetic variants associated with increased stone risk, but none are solely responsible. Environmental exposures like dietary oxalate intake likely also interact with genetic factors.

The article notes that focusing solely on a single cause may limit clinical evaluation and treatment options. A more comprehensive approach considering multiple interacting factors is needed. Understanding complex contributors rather than narrowly focusing on a single cause could lead to improved prevention strategies tailored to individual patients based on their unique risk factor profiles. Overall, the article emphasizes the challenges of definitively identifying a clear single cause for some patients' kidney stones and argues a broader approach considering interactions between genetics and environment is often warranted.

 Here is a summary of the key points from the study references provided:

- Holmes et al. (1995) found that in short-term studies with male participants normally consuming 200 mg oxalate, oxalate excretion often decreased. 

- Vermeulen et al. (1967) created oxalate stone disease in rats by feeding a high oxalate "trigger" dose for 4 days followed by a moderate oxalate maintenance diet for 24 days. Without the trigger or maintenance diet, few stones formed. 

- Marengo et al. (2013) tested and confirmed Vermeulen's trigger-maintenance theory in a similar rat study.

- Blumenfrucht et al. (1986) found multiorgan crystal deposition in rats after intravenous oxalate infusion, demonstrating oxalate can distribute systemically.

- Zimmermann et al. (2005) found increased intestinal oxalate absorption in participants when their intake increased to 600 mg oxalate. 

- Balcke et al. (1989) found transient hyperoxaluria in participants after eating just 50g of milk chocolate.

- Detection of oxalate crystals requires careful preparation and microscopy, and crystals can still be mistaken for others. Crystals are also easy to miss or destroy.

- Oxalate deposits have been found in various tissues beyond just the kidneys, such as liver, blood vessels, eyes, thyroid, breasts, teeth, bones and joints. 

- Clinical scans cannot reliably detect oxalate crystals. Crystals from ethylene glycol ingestion led to neurological issues.

- Oxalate accumulation can lead to tissue degeneration in various organs over time.

In summary, the studies suggest oxalate may accumulate systemically and be underdetected, with implications for multiple organ health over the long term. Both acute high doses and persistent lower intakes may play a role in crystal formation and deposition.

 

- Bone oxalosis (buildup of calcium oxalate crystals in bone tissue) may be more common than previously thought. Crystals have been found in various connective tissues like the intervertebral disc and around joint spaces. 

- Oxalate crystals have been observed in synovial fluid of an arthritic knee and are associated with Parkinson's disease. 

- Glycosaminoglycans found in tissues help prevent crystal attachment. Inflammation, low oxygen, and low pH interfere with this prevention. Crystals can cling to damaged cell membranes. 

- Tissues like thyroid, salivary glands, and pancreas concentrate oxalate through membrane transporters. This may lead to oxalate accumulation problems under certain conditions. 

- Salivary glands concentrate oxalate, which may contribute to salivary stone formation. 

- Oxalate crystal deposits can provoke chronic inflammatory disease through mechanisms like macrophage activation. Smaller "stealthy" nanocrystals may be especially destructive. 

- Oxalate-induced inflammation can occur in any tissue. Oxalate is considered a candidate for contributing to kidney disease progression through inflammatory pathways. 

- Immune cells responding to oxalate crystals can cluster together forming structures called granulomas, which act as containment devices for crystals. Granulomas are often asymptomatic but sarcoidosis can develop if the immune response isn't contained.

 Here is a summary of the case report:

The study presented a case report of a 65-year-old postmenopausal woman who presented with abnormal uterine bleeding. She underwent endometrial biopsy which showed non-caseating granulomas indicative of sarcoidosis involving the endometrium. Sarcoidosis is a multi-system disorder of unknown cause characterized by the formation of non-caseating granulomas. While pulmonary involvement is most common, extrapulmonary sarcoidosis can involve any organ. Endometrial sarcoidosis is extremely rare. On further workup, the patient was found to have bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy on chest x-ray and elevation of serum angiotensin converting enzyme, further supporting the diagnosis of sarcoidosis. The granulomas resolved with steroid treatment. This case highlights that endometrial sarcoidosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of postmenopausal bleeding, though it is an uncommon cause. Recognizing this entity is important for guiding appropriate management.

 This summary covers 16 references related to oxalates, inflammation, and fibrosis. Key points include:

- Oxalate crystals can cause inflammation and damage tissues like bone and blood vessels. Immune responses generate more chemicals that sustain inflammation. 

- Osteopontin (OPN) is produced in response to oxalate crystals and needed for immune functions. Chronic high OPN can lead to crystal retention and scar tissue formation. 

- Granulomas forming around crystals may cause long-term tissue changes similar to conditions like asbestosis. 

- Oxalate damage impairs the replacement of normal cells, allowing scar tissue to continue growing unchecked. This non-resolving fibrosis affects many organs and joints. 

- Eliminating the cause (oxalates) may be needed to stop fibrosis, as anti-inflammatory drugs alone do not stop the scarring process once initiated by tissue damage. Overall it covers the cycle of oxalate damage, inflammation, scarring and impaired healing seen in conditions involving excess oxalates in the body.

 Here is a summary of the article "Common Pathway to Organ Injury and Failure" from The New England Journal of Medicine:

- The article proposes that many forms of organ injury and failure may arise from a common pathway involving tissue deposition of microscopic crystals. Once crystals are deposited in tissues, they can trigger inflammation and eventually fibrosis. 

- Specific types of crystals discussed include calcium-containing crystals like calcium oxalate and calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate. Oxalate crystals in particular have been shown to cause renal fibrosis by activating macrophages and fibroblasts. 

- Crystal deposition often results from an initial injury to epithelial or endothelial barriers that allows crystals to penetrate tissues where they are not normally found. This can happen when normal cells regain their ability to reproduce after injury or infection. 

- Overall the article hypothesizes that crystal deposition may be a common downstream mechanism leading to organ dysfunction after various forms of initial injury or cellular mutations predisposing to crystal formation. This proposes a unified pathway that could explain similarities between different disease processes.

 Here is a summary of the key points from the 1984 NIH publication "CNS: A Series of Hypotheses, Perspectives for Research":

- The document outlines various hypotheses for central nervous system (CNS) disease mechanisms and puts forth perspectives to guide future CNS research. 

- It discusses how neurotransmitters, neuroendocrines, and immunological mechanisms may play a role in CNS disorders like multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, affective disorders, schizophrenia, and dementias. 

- Neurotransmitter hypotheses focus on abnormalities in neurotransmitter systems like serotonin, dopamine, acetylcholine, GABA, glutamate, and endogenous opioids. Imbalances in these systems may underlie certain CNS disorders.

- Neuroendocrine hypotheses examine the interactions between the CNS, endocrine system, and immune system. Hormones and cytokines produced in the CNS like endorphins could influence or be influenced by CNS diseases. 

- Immunological hypotheses center on the idea that autoimmune or inflammatory reactions against CNS tissues may be involved in some disorders. 

- The document advocates an interdisciplinary approach to CNS research integrating multiple levels of analysis from molecular to behavioral. It also stresses the importance of animal models and new technologies.

- The overall goal is to generate testable hypotheses about disease mechanisms to advance understanding and development of new prevention and treatment strategies.

- Gouty arthritis can result from five types of crystals, including calcium oxalate.

- Arthritis, bursitis, and tendinitis can be caused by calcium oxalate and other crystal deposits. 

- As people age, their bones become harder/denser but more porous, allowing calcium oxalate and other crystals to deposit. This may lead to spinal stenosis and bone deformities.

- Crystal deposits, especially calcium oxalate, promote bone loss by stimulating cells called osteoclasts that break down bone tissue. 

- Immune reactions against crystals are even more destructive to bone compared to the crystals alone. 

- Oxalate deposits in tissues can become severe, affecting bones, oral tissues, and other organs. 

- Oxalate toxicity has been linked to conditions like hearing loss, anemia, kidney injury, interstitial cystitis, and urinary problems. 

- High urine oxalate leads to crystal clumping and aggregation, which can damage kidneys and other tissues. 

- A common pathway may underlie issues like kidney stones, bone disease and cardiovascular problems related to calcium metabolism and oxalate overload.

- The varying symptoms of oxalate overload may stem from its effects on immune activation and disruption of intestinal barrier function.

- Urea has been found to have antioxidant effects that could help counter damage from calcium oxalate crystals under some conditions.

 Here are the summaries of the note references in text:

- Low magnesium may contribute to issues with neuronal maturation and neuropathology. Studies have shown magnesium plays a key role. 

- Without adequate magnesium, recovery from oxalate toxicity is difficult. Magnesium deficiency has been linked to early signs of cardiovascular, skeletal, and renal problems. Studies show magnesium supplementation can improve issues like carotid intima thickness in hemodialysis patients.

- L-threonate has an increased ability to cross the blood-brain barrier compared to other magnesium forms. A study showed normalization of magnesium deficiency via L-threonate attenuated mechanical allodynia and improved depression and memory issues associated with cystitis. 

- The Recommended Dietary Allowance for potassium is 4,700 mg per day according to data from What We Eat in America 2009-2010 surveys. 

- High potassium intake supports rebuilding demineralized bones and preventing bone loss. It can also prevent fibrosis and kidney stone formation by affecting diet-dependent net acid levels. 

- Potassium directly inhibits free radical formation, according to a study showing this effect. 

- Doses of potassium used in studies showing benefits to endothelial function and cardiovascular risk factors were around half the amounts used in clinical trials to treat hypertensive patients.

- Low magnesium turns on sodium-retaining hormones like FGF23, which regulates sodium handling and blood pressure, according to a study on this mechanism.

- Sulfur amino acid deficiency can result from lack of dietary methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), an organic form of sulfur, according to a review of sulfur's role in human nutrition.

- MSM supports skin, vascular, and stomach health, according to several studies showing these benefits. It also aids bone/tooth repair and regeneration. 

- MSM may help with issues like fibromyalgia, arthritis, and interstitial cystitis, according to the same review citing its applications. Gradually increasing doses if well tolerated was advised by a study on MSM's effect on joints and mobility.

- While silicon supports bone and connective tissue health, breathing in silica crystals from soil can be toxic, according to a review of silicon compounds' effects. Studies showed silicon supports bone health and prevents osteopenia.

- Tap water contains not just toxic metals but other additives, while bottled water may leach plastic residues and lacks important minerals, according to reviews of chemical quality. De-ionized filters can restore some trace minerals. 

- Citric acid/citrate is a well-established treatment for kidney stones, increasing protection from oxalate and interacting with transporters to regulate levels. It also reduces osteopontin levels linked to stone formation.

- Citrate promotes strong bones and teeth by improving mineralization at collagen-mineral interfaces, according to studies cited. It helps reverse bone loss from conditions like osteoporosis. 

- Factors like low fluid intake and high animal protein diets can lower urinary citrate levels and increase stone risk. Bicarbonate also reduces tissue acidity.

 Here are summaries of the key articles:

- Pinheiro et al. (2013): Studied the effect of oral sodium bicarbonate supplementation on urinary citrate levels in calcium oxalate stone formers. Found that sodium bicarbonate significantly increased urinary citrate levels compared to placebo, suggesting it may help prevent kidney stone formation by increasing citrate excretion in the urine. 

- Simpson (1963): Examined tissue citrate levels and citrate utilization after oral sodium bicarbonate administration in rats. Found that sodium bicarbonate increased citrate levels in various tissues including kidney and liver, supporting its role in increasing urinary citrate excretion.

- Chung et al. (2016): Identified a compound called hydroxycitrate that inhibits pathological crystal growth, suggesting it may have therapeutic potential for reducing kidney stone risk. 

- Kim et al. (2019): Reviewed the potential role of hydroxycitrate supplementation as a new treatment for calcium kidney stones based on its ability to inhibit stone formation as shown in the 2016 study.

 Here is a summary of the key points from the article:

- Folic acid supplementation has traditionally been recommended to help prevent neural tube defects in babies. However, recent evidence suggests folic acid may not be beneficial and could even be harmful for some individuals. 

- There is concern that unmetabolized folic acid from supplements may accumulate in bodies and interact with other nutrients like vitamin B12. This could mask vitamin B12 deficiency and pose risks for cognitive health.

- Studies show that for some people, folic acid supplementation is associated with increased risks for cancers like prostate cancer. The mechanism is not fully understood but may relate to interactions with natural folate metabolism.

- Natural folate from foods is likely safer than synthetic folic acid from supplements. More research is still needed, but excessive folic acid intake from fortified foods and supplements should be avoided, especially for the elderly. 

- Overall the article questions the assumption that folic acid is universally good for everyone and suggests more targeted recommendations may be warranted based on individual characteristics and disease risk factors. More individualized approaches to folate and folic acid intake are discussed.

In summary, the article raises concerns about potential risks from excessive and indiscriminate folic acid intake from supplements and fortified foods, especially for certain high-risk groups. It suggests folic acid may not be beneficial and could even be harmful for some individuals.

 

- Reducing oxalate intake through a low-oxalate diet can help manage or prevent kidney stones and other health issues. A low-oxalate diet focuses on limiting high-oxalate foods and selecting safer options.

- Different food preparation methods can affect the oxalate content of foods. Methods like cooking, blending, and juicing can increase absorbable oxalates. 

- When switching to a low-oxalate diet, it's important to replace high-oxalate foods with substitute foods to maintain a balanced nutrition. Some options for replacing high-oxalate foods are provided. 

- Portion sizes are important when considering oxalate intake from foods. Targets and guidelines are given for meeting daily oxalate intake levels. 

- "Safe bet" foods are those generally lower in oxalates that can form the basis of a low-oxalate diet. The worst high-oxalate offender foods are also identified.

- Gut health plays a role in oxalate absorption and clearance from the body. Probiotics and other supportive strategies can help optimize digestion.

- Stories from people who have benefited from adopting a low-oxalate diet are shared as examples. Adapting the diet as healing progresses is also discussed.

- Guidelines are provided for a phased approach to a low-oxalate diet as well as tips for long-term success in maintaining the diet lifestyle. Mineral and vitamin supplementation can also support the diet.

 Here are the key points from the summary:

- The text discusses transitioning diets to be lower in oxalates, including whole foods, pescatarian, and Paleo diets. 

- It provides examples of meals for each diet at a high, phase one reduction, and low oxalate level, listing the specific foods and estimated oxalate amounts.

- The whole foods transition shows reducing spinach, potatoes, nuts/seeds, and replacing with options like broccoli, rice pasta, fish. 

- The pescatarian transition reduces chia pudding, kiwi, quinoa for options like salmon, pineapple, dandelion greens.

- The Paleo transition reduces berries, nuts, spinach "cheese" for options like sausage hash, clam chowder, zucchini.

- The goal is to gradually lower oxalate intake to lessen burden on the kidneys and avoid potential symptoms from excessive oxalates.

So in summary, it provides dietary transition plans and examples for lowering oxalate levels within different diets like whole foods, pescatarian and Paleo. The key is making gradual reductions and substitutions to maintain nutritional balance.

 Here is a summary of the meal plan provided:

Breakfast: Scrambled eggs with sausage hash (no carrot). Contains 5 mg of oxalates. 

Or: 1/2 cup sardine mash in coconut yogurt. Contains 1 mg of oxalates.

- The data provides oxalate content information for a wide range of foods, including nuts, grains, fruits, breads, beverages and teas. 

- For each food item, it lists the total oxalate content per 100g, the percentage that is water-soluble, and the amount needed to reach 20mg and 30mg of oxalate intake (in grams and approximate servings).

- Nuts vary in oxalate levels depending on whether raw or roasted. Peanuts, almonds and roasted peanuts are among the higher oxalate nuts. 

- Grains like buckwheat, millet and quinoa are moderate to higher in oxalate, while rice and oats are lower. 

- Many fruits contain oxalates, with levels varying significantly. Figs, oranges, berries and plantains are higher, while citrus tends to be moderate. 

- Breads like rye, pumpernickel and whole wheat have higher oxalate than white bread. Bagels and oat breads are moderate. 

- Beverages like almond milk, coffee drinks and tea all contribute modest amounts of oxalate to the diet depending on serving size.

So in summary, the data provides a useful breakdown of oxalate levels in a wide range of common foods to help assess dietary intake. Nuts, grains and some fruits tend to be higher sources.

 Here is a summary of the key points about oxalates and foods from the provided information:

- Oxalates are naturally occurring substances found in many plants that act as a defense against predators. However, high oxalate intake can be harmful to humans.

- The recommended daily limit for oxalate intake is 120-150 mg per day for most adults. Exceeding this amount may lead to adverse health effects over time. 

- Many "healthy" foods that are promoted such as nuts, seeds, beans, chocolate, tea, and some spices contain substantial amounts of oxalates. Overconsumption of these foods could potentially cause oxalate overload.

- The solubility percentage listed indicates how well the oxalates in a particular food are absorbed in the body. Higher solubility means more oxalates will enter the bloodstream.

- The amount of food listed to equal 20-30 mg of oxalates provides a guide for limiting intake of high oxalate foods. For example, 1-2 tablespoons of carob powder or 10-15 plantain chips.

- Symptoms of oxalate overload can be difficult to diagnose due to their wide variation and lack of reliable tests. Buildup of oxalates in tissues over time may contribute to various health issues.

- Managing oxalate intake and supporting kidney function are important aspects of addressing oxalate balance and preventing potential issues. A low-oxalate diet phase may be needed in some cases.
