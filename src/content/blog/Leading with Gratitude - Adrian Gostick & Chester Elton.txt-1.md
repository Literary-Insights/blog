 In summary, the key points are:

• WD-40 Company experienced great financial and employee engagement success after implementing a policy of expressing gratitude to employees. CEO Garry Ridge instructed managers to show appreciation more regularly. 

• Researchers found that people are less likely to express gratitude at work than anywhere else. 81% of workers say they would work harder if their boss showed more appreciation, and over 90% believe grateful bosses are more successful.

• The authors coined the term "gratitude gap" to describe the disconnect between knowing that gratitude works yet many leaders failing to practice it effectively. 

• There are many reasons leaders fail to show enough gratitude, despite knowing its importance. The authors aim to discover why this "gratitude gap" exists.

• Even star performers often do not receive enough gratitude and appreciation from their bosses.

The WD-40 Company example and research statistics illustrate the large "gratitude gap" that exists in many workplaces, where leaders and managers know gratitude is important yet fail to practice it consistently and effectively. The authors are researching the underlying reasons for this disconnect in order to help close the gratitude gap and better inform leaders on how to express appreciation meaningfully.

 Here is a summary of the text:

In 1998, Jerry Krause, general manager of the Chicago Bulls, said "Players and coaches don't win championships, organizations do." This downplayed the roles of Michael Jordan and Phil Jackson, key players in the team's championship run. After Jordan and Jackson left, the Bulls struggled to win another championship.

The authors argue that a lack of gratitude is a form of stupidity. Genuine gratitude involves carefully observing employees' contributions, developing empathy, and expressing heartfelt appreciation. This can boost performance, morale, and retention. While many see gratitude as "being nice", the authors argue it requires being demanding while also expressing gratitude authentically. Studies show expressing gratitude improves health and wellbeing.

However, some leaders are reluctant to express gratitude. They may feel it diminishes their own credit or they have a need for control. Busyness and carelessness can also get in the way of showing gratitude. But leaders who express gratitude frequently build positive team cultures and achieve higher business results.

In summary, the text argues that genuine gratitude towards employees is important for business performance, employee morale and retention, yet many leaders fail to express it due to insecurity, control issues or carelessness. Expressing gratitude authentically requires understanding employees' specific contributions and challenges.

 Here is a summary of the provided text:

1. Hubert Joly warned about the dangers of leaders being seduced by power and glory, forgetting to give credit to others. 

2. Humans have a "negativity bias" where they tend to focus more on problems than positive things. This evolved as a survival mechanism but can make leaders overlook expressing gratitude.

3. Some leaders think withholding gratitude keeps people on edge and working harder, but research shows gratitude helps people cope with adversity and boosts productivity.

4. A reciprocal ethic underlies human nature - we feel an obligation to repay those who help us. But leaders forget this when caught up in negativity.  

5. Rebecca Douglas's story about the grateful leprosy colony boy illustrates how gratitude can uplift even in dire circumstances. 

6. Some skepticism about gratitude in business comes from past forced or disingenuous efforts. But true servant leadership means putting others first.

7. The authors aim to convince readers that gratitude is good for people, businesses and leaders themselves. They will teach how to overcome reservations and embrace gratitude effectively.

8. Leaders the authors interviewed believe gratitude has transformed their businesses and lives. They want to share how essential it is with other leaders.

9. Gail Miller's story shows how gratitude can help a leader cope with adversity after assuming a challenging new role.

 Here is a summary of the provided text:

• While many managers don't consciously try to instill fear in their employees, their actions and words can inadvertently spread fear and anxiety. This leads to less motivation and lower performance.

• Fear can get short-term results, but over time it undermines performance. Stress, doubt and uncertainty caused by fear reduce innovation and motivation. 

• Chronic stress from fear negatively impacts sleep and energy levels, potentially leading to burnout.

• The fight-or-flight response to fear is often misdirected at managers instead of actual challenges. Employees may resent managers they view as unfair or uncaring. 

• When employees work in fear-based cultures, they spend time and energy defending themselves and blaming others instead of finding solutions.

The key point is that while fear can achieve some short-term results, it is not a sustainable way to motivate employees. Fear leads to stress, resentment, defensive behavior and reduced performance over the long term. Leading with gratitude, appreciation and inspiration is a smarter approach.

Hope this summary helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

 Here is a summary of the key points:

1. Fear-based management is ultimately ineffective and counterproductive. While it may seem like a tough management style gets results, instilling fear actually undermines performance and motivation.

2. Many managers mistakenly think fear is the path to respect, but respect comes from caring about people and helping them grow, not from intimidation.

3. The machismo of fear-based leaders gets exaggerated attention, but in reality people want leaders who show vulnerability and empathy.

4. Simple acts of caring, like listening, admitting mistakes, and giving credit, can dispel fear and build real respect in teams. 

5. Case studies show that replacing fear with a culture of openness, trust, and support can work wonders to improve teamwork and performance.

In summary, the passage argues that fear is not an effective management strategy. While fear-based tactics may seem tough, they backfire by undermining motivation, innovation and authentic respect from employees. The essay makes the case that managers who show real care and concern for their people, and who build an environment of trust and openness, are ultimately more effective and gain greater loyalty and commitment from their teams.

 Here's a summary of the provided text:

The text argues that employees of all ages, not just millennials, desire more consistent feedback and guidance from managers. While overpraise by parents can breed narcissism in children, regular, deserved praise at work does not cause problems.

The story of Anne, a successful sales rep who left her previous job due to lack of acknowledgment from her manager, illustrates this point. Millennials and Gen Z workers are often criticized for wanting too much praise, but research shows they primarily want clarity on their performance and impact. Around 65% of all employees want more feedback than they currently receive. 

Narcissism among youth is rising, but this is due more to parental overvaluation and inflated views of children, not praise itself. Self-esteem is predicted by parental warmth, not constant praise. 

The key to effective praise is to acknowledge positive behaviors regularly, not overvalue people in every aspect. Research shows that regular, deserved praise does not lead to inflated egos. What employees of all ages truly want is guidance and clarity on their job performance and contributions.

 Here is a summary of the provided text:

- Providing reinforcement for positive behaviors and praise for work well done is essential in raising healthy, well-adjusted children.

- Leaders should avoid taking on a parental role with employees where they try to "fix" who the person is. This damages the work culture.

- Some leaders withhold praise because they did not receive enough gratitude from their own bosses or parents. But they should not perpetuate this cycle.

- While some people thrive despite lacking appreciation, most flourish with authentic recognition and praise. 

- While some employees may seem awkward receiving compliments, most are generally pleased when their work is acknowledged. It just takes practice.

- True that too much praise can be counterproductive, but in reality most employees don't complain of being overpraised - they feel their efforts go unnoticed.

- Research found that fundraisers who received daily, targeted praise from their manager made 50% more calls, showing frequent gratitude did not lose its impact.

- Studies found couples who stayed married showed a ratio of at least 5 positive interactions for every negative one during conflict. This predicted relationship success.

- In summary, providing regular, authentic praise and recognition for good work is essential for engaged and motivated employees.

 Here is a summary of the provided text:

While leaders claim to be too busy to express gratitude, the benefits can outweigh the costs. Expressing gratitude to employees:

• Reduces employee turnover, which is costly due to ramp-up time, training, mistakes, and reduced productivity of colleagues. The best  employees are the most likely to leave.

• Taps into employee energy, talents, and insights that can help improve performance and execute strategies. Employees often have good ideas if leaders listen. 

• Requires only 1-2 hours per week if done effectively. This is a small investment for the returns.

Gratitude opens communication channels so employees can share concerns, ideas, and insights that can help strategies. While leaders focus on data and hard facts, they often overlook employees' roles in execution.

Effectively communicating strategies to employees and gaining their feedback beforehand can boost alignment and buy-in. However, leaders often keep strategies confidential rather than involving employees beyond surface level.

Grattitude is a two-way street. When leaders pay attention to what employees are contributing, employees are more likely to share useful information that can improve performance.

Even busy leaders can find 1-2 hours per week to express gratitude by optimizing efficiency, focusing their energy, and cutting down on distractions and unproductive tasks. The benefits for employee engagement and performance can be significant.

 Here are the key points around the myth that "I'm not wired to feel grateful":

1. While some people do have genetic predispositions and brain structures that make them more or less prone to gratitude, that does not mean personality traits are set in stone.

2. Neuroplasticity shows that the brain can change and adapt based on our behavior. The neural pathways we use the most strengthen over time.

3. As we practice behaviors that don't come naturally, they can become more natural over time through "use-dependent cortical reorganization."

4. Studies show people are able to change measurable aspects of their personalities with effort over time.

5. Habits are formed through a cue or trigger, a routine, and a reward. To develop a gratitude habit, we can replace less desirable behaviors and routines with grateful ones.

So in summary, while our genetic wiring and natural dispositions influence our behaviors, they do not determine them. Through effort, practice and forming new habits, we can develop more gratitude over time, even if it does not come naturally at first. Our brains are capable of change through neuroplasticity.

Hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

 Summarizing the text:

1) Some managers save their praise for only those who they think "deserve it", mostly high performers. They discount the value of "basic" jobs.

2) But even "simple" jobs can make a big impact when done well. A janitor at a hospital who showed kindness and care helped patients maintain their dignity. 

3) All employees have the potential to make valuable contributions if inspired properly. Expressing gratitude can motivate even average performers to improve.

4) Managers should try to give gratitude to everyone on the team from time to time, though some will receive more due to high performance. This prevents jealousy.

5) The Pareto principle , which argues that 20% of people produce 80% of results, is flawed. Helping the other 80% improve can substantially boost overall performance.

6) A story showed how even a simple expression of appreciation for an "important" job motivated a young worker to engage and do her best. This shaped her career.

The key points are that expressing gratitude can benefit all types of employees and jobs, not just "deserving" high performers. Appreciation has the power to inspire workers and improve performance, even for those doing average work. Managers shouldn't discount the value of "basic" jobs but seek ways to motivate those who do them through thanks and recognition.

 Here is a summary of the key points in the passage:

1. Monetary rewards alone are not very motivating and often fail to provide lasting motivation and gratitude. Cash bonuses are often seen as an impersonal ritual rather than a sincere expression of appreciation. 

2. Compensation is important but there are issues with relying solely on pay and bonuses, like pay inequities, unawareness of how bonuses are calculated, and unrealistic goals.

3. Money often ranks low on what motivates employees, below factors like meaningful work and recognition. Pay is more of a threshold issue - once basic needs are met, other factors become more motivating.

4. Tangible gifts and recognition can be more motivating than cash bonuses. What matters most is knowing one's boss appreciates their efforts.

5. Some goals and work cannot be tied to a monetary metric, so assigning a dollar value may devalue the effort or demotivate employees. 

6. Cash bonus programs can incentivize gaming the system rather than motivating better performance.

7. The authors argue that while compensation is important, gratitude and recognition have a more meaningful and lasting impact on employee motivation. They don't suggest gratitude can replace appropriate pay, but should supplement it.

In summary, the key takeaway is that gratitude, recognition and non-monetary rewards can be more motivating for employees than cash alone, though compensation remains an important factor. The authors advocate for a balanced approach that provides both fair pay and meaningful expressions of appreciation.

 Here is a summary of the provided text:

Leaders who are worried that expressing more gratitude will seem inauthentic or manipulative can be reassured that if their intent is genuine, it will be received well. There are a few key points:

1. People appreciate positive changes in behavior, especially from bosses. Employees will give leaders the benefit of the doubt and support their efforts to grow and improve. 

2. Being open and honest about why the change is being made, and acknowledging past mistakes, shows respect and will be valued by the team.

3. Expressing gratitude authentically without attaching strings or ulterior motives is what matters most. People are sensitive to the leader's true intent.

4. While it may initially feel awkward or uncomfortable, sticking with the practice consistently over time will allow the positive effects to become evident to the team.

5. The key is to ensure the gratitude is genuine and comes from a place of recognizing and appreciating the true value others provide. 

In summary, leaders should not be deterred from expressing more gratitude due to worries about inauthenticity. If the intent is genuine, done consistently, and without strings attached, it will be recognized and appreciated by their teams.

 Here's a summary of the key points in the text:

1. Actively soliciting input and feedback from employees can lead to good ideas that help improve the business. Employees may have insights and perspectives that managers lack. 

2. Many managers are reluctant to solicit employee ideas, believing employees don't understand the business issues. However, managers can talk to employees to explain constraints and gain their understanding.

3. When receiving ideas, managers should focus employees on feasible solutions and thank them for their input, even if ideas can't be implemented. This assures employees their suggestions were considered.

4. Kent Taylor of Texas Roadhouse credits the company's success to listening to employee ideas. Suggestions have led to initiatives like line dancing performances and changes to the menu.

5. Taylor actively seeks feedback from servers, kitchen staff, and other employees to identify opportunities. He personally calls store managers to ask about issues and ideas.

6. While soliciting employee ideas has benefits, managers must be careful not to overburden employees with demands or unrealistic expectations. Focusing on feasible suggestions employees can implement is key.

In summary, actively listening to and acting on employee ideas can generate suggestions that improve business performance, as long as managers communicate effectively with employees and show appreciation for input.

 Here is a summary of the key points in the provided text:

1. Many leaders assume that employees' mistakes are due to carelessness or incompetence. They jump to conclusions that employees have mal intentions.  

2. In reality, most employees care about their work and try to do a good job. Performance issues are often due to lack of proper tools, training, or clear direction from leaders.

3. The text argues leaders should assume positive intent from employees. That employees likely have innocent reasons for mistakes they make, and are not deliberately trying to undermine the leader.

4. Indra Nooyi, former CEO of PepsiCo, advised leaders to "assume positive intent." This changes a leader's whole approach to people and problems for the better.

5. When leaders assume negative intent from employees, they become annoyed and angry with those who bring them problems. But assuming positive intent helps leaders solve issues constructively.

In summary, the key takeaway is that leaders are encouraged to assume employees have positive intent and innocent reasons for mistakes, rather than jumping to conclusions about carelessness or malicious intent. This allows leaders to solve issues more constructively.

 Here is a summary of the key points:

1. Assuming positive intent from employees and giving them the benefit of the doubt can help create a more collaborative and innovative culture. It can uncover mistakes before they become big problems and provide learning opportunities.

2. Punitive reactions and a low trust environment discourage creativity and innovation. People are less likely to speak up with new ideas.

3. Even when employees are at fault for mistakes, it's better to see it as a chance to teach rather than punish. This helps fix the problem and prevent recurrence.

4. To stay composed when learning of mistakes, leaders should pick up the phone, gather all facts first before judging, take a forward-looking approach, and avoid passive-aggressive language.  

5. Positive thinking and viewing failures as learning moments can fuel innovation and productivity. 

6. A leader's positive and supportive reactions, even when employees disappoint, can sometimes inspire them to change.

7. Training children and employees to avoid failure at all costs prevents them from learning what true success requires.

 Here is a summary of the key points in the text:

1. Many leaders do not fully understand the challenges their employees face in their daily work. Simply observing employees or doing their jobs themselves can give leaders valuable insights.

2. Empathy and truly understanding employees' work enables leaders to better assist and improve results. 

3. The Fairmont Hotel program "Walk in Your Shoes" had leaders work directly with employees to gain a firsthand understanding of their jobs. This led to many good ideas to improve processes.

4. Research shows empathy is critical for effective management but many leaders lack time or proximity to employees to develop empathy. 

5. Leaders can still gain insights by regularly asking employees about their work and listening to stories of their accomplishments.

6. A simple pause by a CEO to listen to an accountant's story of convincing a client to pay early gave the CEO a chance to express sincere gratitude.

7. Employees doing important behind-the-scenes work often do not receive proper recognition from leaders.

8. Actually observing employees at work, even for a short time, can give leaders valuable insights to help employees and improve productivity.

In summary, walking in employees' shoes through observation, doing their jobs, or simply listening can build empathy that enables leaders to better assist employees, improve processes, and properly recognize good work.

 Here is a summary of the key points regarding empathy in the workplace:

• Leaders should make an effort to regularly connect with employees by asking "What's new?" and trying to create a real connection through empathy.

• Leaders should observe employees' work to notice examples of excellence and issues they face, with empathy and without feeling like surveillance. 

• When leaders spot good work, they should give public recognition to show respect and build morale. 

• Leaders can walk in employees' shoes by spending time doing their actual work to develop true empathy and identify ways to improve performance and customer experience.

• Leaders should give constructive feedback and advice to employees with radical candor - stemming from empathy, a desire to help, and gratitude for the person.

• Developing empathy muscles takes practice and conscious effort, but the benefits for relationships and performance are significant. 

• Leaders may need to work on empathetic listening skills to avoid coming across as self-centered or abrupt, particularly under stress. Coaching can help identify areas for improvement.

Overall, the key takeaway is that developing empathy for employees through regular interactions, observation, and even working alongside them can dramatically improve relationships, morale, and performance in an organization. But leaders must make a conscious effort to practice and develop those empathy skills.

 Here are the key highlights from the summary:

1. Express gratitude for small wins and incremental progress. Significant achievements often start with many small steps. Appreciating employees for making progress, no matter how small, keeps them motivated and inspired.

2. Regular gratitude for small wins shows employees that their work is noticed and valued. It also gives them confidence to continue progressing towards bigger goals. 

3. Expressing gratitude for small wins signals to employees that you understand what's going on in their work and care about their progress.

4. While it's important to recognize top performers, don't neglect thankfuling your "Steady Eddys" - those employees who show up every day and do reliable work that keeps the business running. They need encouragement too.

5. Look for small wins every day that you can acknowledge. This helps inspire all your people to stretch and grow, not just your star performers.

In summary, expressing gratitude for small accomplishments and incremental progress, on a regular basis, keeps employees motivated, productive, and engaged in their work. Make it a point to notice and appreciate the small wins - they often pave the way for greater success.

 Here is a summary of the provided text:

The article discusses the importance of recognizing and rewarding small wins in the workplace. Spotting and appreciating small successes can boost employee engagement and motivation. Several ways leaders can elicit small wins from team members are mentioned:

- Ask team members to give shout-outs to each other. This provides recognition to employees who don't always get the spotlight and breaks down silos between departments.

- Ask team members to report their own small wins. This shows gratitude and teaches employees what they learned from the experience. 

- Set goals for daily, weekly or 30-day achievements and reward employees for hitting them. This keeps momentum rolling.

- Thank employees who offer good ideas, find productivity hacks, resolve conflicts and achieve work anniversaries. This encourages innovation and reduces conflicts.

The article recommends leaders keep a gratitude journal to write down small wins as they see them so they can promptly thank employees. Immediate recognition is important.

Spotting small wins becomes a habit that positively changes a leader's outlook and perspective. It teaches them to appreciate how contributions outweigh challenges.

In summary, recognizing and rewarding small wins through gratitude and appreciation can boost employee engagement and morale in meaningful ways.

 Here is a summary of the key points:

• Expressing gratitude immediately after an achievement is most meaningful. Delayed feedback, like at annual performance reviews, can feel less sincere.

• Even small progress on projects can boost employee motivation and morale, while setbacks can be disproportionately demotivating. Frequent feedback helps employees see their progress and gain perspective.

• The mind is designed for regular feedback. Delays in expressing gratitude can cause resentment and undermine the message. Timely appreciation signals that a leader cares and prioritizes giving credit.

• Managers often rely on quantitative performance metrics, but overlook day-to-day qualitative contributions that are harder to measure. Frequent gratitude acknowledges a wider range of achievements.

• Annual performance reviews tend to be weighted toward criticism. Positive reinforcement throughout the year tempers the impact of negative feedback in reviews.

The key takeaway is that expressing gratitude in the moment, rather than waiting, provides valuable and motivating feedback that can lift employee spirits and boost their progress and productivity at work. Timely gratitude also signals that a leader values acknowledging contributions.

 Here is a summary of the key points in the passage:

- Employees appreciate gratitude and acknowledgement from their bosses for good work. A lack of appreciation can cause irritation. 

- Immediate expressions of gratitude are more effective than delayed ones. Rewarded behavior is likely to repeat.

- Surveys show that employees value gratitude from their bosses around once a week. Even in large teams, leaders can ensure employees receive appreciation.

- Frequent gratitude helps boost morale and motivation by acknowledging progress. It gives employees perspective on setbacks.

- Leaders should not fear expressing gratitude too often. There is no such thing as too much praise, as long as it is heartfelt and specific.

- Leaders should avoid mingling criticism with gratitude. Focus on positive words and language. 

- Employees are unlikely to get jealous if gratitude is frequent and aligned with core values. Gratitude does not get "trite" with frequency. Leaders can ask employees to help identify things to celebrate.  

The key takeaways are that leaders should express gratitude often, immediately after good work is done, and not be afraid of giving too much praise. Frequent and timely gratitude acts as positive reinforcement that improves motivation and productivity.

 Here is a summary of the provided text:

The key takeaways from the text are:

1) Individuals have unique combinations of motivators that drive them at work. Generic or one-size-fits-all expressions of gratitude are often less meaningful. 

2) Tailoring gratitude to an individual's specific motivators and nature shows empathy and awareness, making the recognition more valuable.

3. However, people should still appreciate all sincere gratitude they receive, even if it is not perfectly tailored. Being gracious and accepting compliments pays dividends.  

4) Leaders often look through their own lens when expressing gratitude, missing the unique preferences of individuals. But understanding individual motivators allows for targeted recognition.

5. There is no clear formula for assigning value to achievements when expressing gratitude. The specific individual's motivators and nature must be considered.

In summary, while tailoring gratitude to an individual's specific motivators and nature yields the most meaningful recognition, all sincere expressions of gratitude should still be appreciated. Targeted expressions of gratitude require understanding individuals' unique motivator profiles rather than assuming a one-size-fits-all approach.

 Here's a summary of the key points regarding expressions of gratitude:

• Generic praise is not as effective as specific, customized gratitude. Mass spraying of "good job" can actually irritate employees who feel disrespected.

• Gratitude should be tailored to the level of achievement: praise-worthy, reward-worthy, platinum, or diamond. These correspond to different magnitudes of impact and appropriate rewards. 

• The example of the employee who fixed the reporting software shows how badly handled gratitude can backfire. He received a delayed, impersonal bonus without any public recognition, diminishing the impact.

• Generic gratitude comes across as oblivious or uncaring. Specific praise shows you understand the value and difficulty of employees' work.

• The example of the father thanking his children generically shows how such empty praise can be misinterpreted. The kids thought their dad didn't understand what they actually did.

The key takeaway is to make expressions of gratitude meaningful and tailored to specific achievements. Generic praise may seem like the easy option, but it often fails to engage employees and can even frustrate them. Customized gratitude that recognizes people's unique contributions is far more impactful and motivating.

 Here is a summary of the key points in the text:

• Core values statements are often vague and lack specifics on how the values should be implemented in practice. This limits their effectiveness.

• Simply communicating core values through posters or wallet cards is not enough; leaders must act in accordance with the values and reinforce them through their actions.

• Expressing gratitude for behaviors that align with core values is an effective way to reinforce the importance of those values and make them come alive in the culture.

• Specific gratitude can provide clarity on what the values mean in practice and give examples of their importance. This puts "flesh on the bones" of the values.

• Documents like Netflix's Culture Deck that define specific expected behaviors based on values can be helpful, but are rare. Positive reinforcement by leaders is still essential.  

• Frances Hesselbein emphasized that values must be linked to desired behaviors and rewarded in order to shape the culture. Gratitude is a powerful way to provide that reward.

The key takeaway is that expressing gratitude for actions that demonstrate core values is an important yet often overlooked tool leaders can use to bring their values to life and shape the organizational culture.

 Here is a summary of key actions and tips to make gratitude and values-based recognition habitual:

1. Begin recognizing values-driven behaviors before new employees are even hired. Share stories of how current employees exemplify the company's values.

2. During new employee onboarding, provide concrete examples of how values have guided behavior and decisions. Use stories to make values come alive.

3. Rank order core values to resolve potential conflicts and guide employees. Explain which values take precedence in different scenarios. 

4. Be prepared to counsel employees who face value conflicts between personal values and company values. Show empathy while clarifying the organization's perspective.

5. Ask team members for suggestions on how to better recognize and appreciate values-aligned behaviors. Involve them in shaping the recognition program.

6. Publicly recognize and thank employees who demonstrate the company values through their work. Leave notes, send thank you cards, and recognize them in front of colleagues.

The main takeaway is that gratitude and recognition work best when explicitly tied to an organization's core values. By showing employees that living the values is noticed and appreciated, you reinforce the behaviors you want to see repeated.

 Here is a summary of the key points in the provided text:

1. Peer-to-peer gratitude is powerful as it comes from colleagues who are most respected by employees. It can invigorate organizations. 

2. Companies with peer recognition systems see benefits like lower turnover and higher engagement.

3. Peer gratitude affirms positive qualities in colleagues like trustworthiness and talent. It creates psychological safety.

4. Leaders should aim for a culture of gratitude that exists at every level, not just from leaders to followers.

5. Peer recognition programs like JetBlue's Lift program correlate with higher employee retention and engagement.

6. Expressing gratitude to and among teammates reinforces the concept that they support each other. This is important for high-performing teams.

In summary, the text advocates for making expressions of gratitude peer-to-peer rather than just top-down from managers. It argues that peer gratitude can reinforce positive team dynamics, values, and psychological safety in powerful ways that benefit organizations.

 Here is a summary of the key points in the text:

1. Peer-to-peer gratitude and appreciation among employees, when encouraged by leaders, can become a valued practice in an organization's culture.

2. Leaders need to model good behavior and clarify what types of gratitude are most meaningful, tied to core values and significant achievements.

3. Social recognition systems and apps can help facilitate employee gratitude, especially for remote workers. However, leaders must also participate and make use of the systems to recognize employees.

4. Simple, informal means of showing thanks, like handwritten notes or public applause, can be effective if not overused. Providing fun tokens or trophies can also serve as gratitude prizes.

5. Technology is not required - analog tools like notecards and applause work well. The key is making expressions of gratitude easy, frequent and specific.

6. Leaders must avoid gamification and other reward tactics that incentivize superficial gratitude. The program should be non-bureaucratic and well communicated.

In summary, peer appreciation among employees is worth cultivating, but leaders play an important role in setting clear expectations, modeling good behavior and using available tools - both technological and low-tech - to facilitate meaningful expressions of gratitude.

 Here's a summary of key takeaways for taking gratitude home:

• Take time once a day to reflect. Consider keeping a gratitude journal where you write down things you're thankful for each day. Even a quick two-minute reflection can boost your mood when you're having a bad day.

• Make it a habit. Practice showing gratitude to your loved ones regularly, not just on special occasions. Even something small like thanking your spouse for doing the dishes or helping with the kids goes a long way.

• Be present. Try to minimize distractions like devices and actually listen to your family members when they speak. Make eye contact and give them your full attention.

• Show physical affection. Hug your kids, hold your partner's hand, give compliments. Physical touch and affection are powerful ways to express gratitude and build closeness.

• Practice gratitude together as a family. Consider writing thank you notes, keeping a family gratitude journal, or taking turns sharing what you're grateful for at dinner each night. Make it a fun ritual that bonds your loved ones.

• Volunteer together. Engaging in service projects where you help others in need is a great way to connect with your family while also cultivating gratitude for what you have.

The main takeaway is that expressing gratitude to loved ones regularly, not just on special occasions, can strengthen your relationships, boost your mood, and make you happier. But it requires consistent practice and mindfulness to combat our busy schedules and distractions.

 Here is a summary of the key points about developing a grateful life:

• Keep a gratitude journal by writing down 3 things you're grateful for every night. This has been shown to increase happiness, energy, and sleep.

• Commit to giving undivided attention when spending time with loved ones. Turn off devices and be fully present.

• At dinner, go around the table and have each person share their favorite moment of the day and one or two people they're grateful for.

• Greet family members with a smile and give them immediate positive feedback when they do something good. Be specific in your thanks.

• Be more grateful and attentive to your partner. Show the same level of interest and gratitude you show at work.  

• Practice random gratitude by smiling at strangers and using their names.

• Be grateful for obstacles and delays. They give you more time for yourself.

• Teach your kids to give to others less fortunate to build character and gratitude for what they have.

The key is to cultivate an attitude of gratitude in the small moments and daily interactions with family and friends. Journaling, intentional listening, and showing appreciation will help develop deeper gratitude in your life.

 Here is a summary of the key points from the Practice Summary section:

1. Research shows that keeping a daily gratitude journal improves happiness and well-being. People who keep gratitude journals report being 25% happier and having lower blood pressure.

2. Other ways to cultivate gratitude in personal life include: giving undivided attention to loved ones, giving immediate positive feedback, being grateful for obstacles, teaching kids to give, serving together as a family, and writing letters of appreciation. 

3. As we practice gratitude with loved ones, we begin to see and value them more. The lessons we learn can also help us at work.

4. Even small acts of gratitude can bring joy to our lives and the lives of others. Leaders are encouraged to start small by practicing just a few habits and seeing the results.

5. The conclusion shares Neil Armstrong's letter of gratitude to the team that designed his spacesuit for the moon landing. Armstrong expressed how the suit worked and enabled his success, despite hiding his "ugly occupant." His gratitude showed the suit's true beauty.

6. Brené Brown's research found that gratitude leads to joy, not the other way around. Practicing gratitude can make us joyful, even if we don't start out feeling that way.

Does this summary cover the key points accurately? Let me know if you need any clarification or would like me to expand on certain details. I'm happy to refine or revise the summary as needed.

 Here's a summary of the key points in the manuscript excerpt:

1. There is a gratitude gap between how grateful employees say they are for their work and how grateful they are toward their bosses. Only 4% of employees are more grateful to their boss than anyplace else, despite research showing grateful bosses are more successful.

2. Fear is not an effective motivator, according to research. Stress hormones released by fear hamper performance. Cultivating respect is a more effective motivational tool. 

3. Contrary to common perception, millennials and Generation Z workers do want more feedback and praise, not just constant praise. However, narcissism has increased across all age groups due to overpraising children.

4. Many managers say they don't have time to show gratitude. But research shows the cost of employee turnover exceeds what managers would spend showing gratitude. Strategies like clarifying and communicating goals can make expressing gratitude easier.

5. Some people feel they are not "wired" for gratitude. But brain plasticity shows people can develop habits that change thought and behavior patterns over time. With practice, nearly anyone can develop a more grateful mindset.

 Here is a summary of the key points in Chapter 13:

1. Researchers Teresa Amabile and Steven Kramer found that small wins and frequent recognition motivate employees more than infrequent large rewards. Small progress and praise boost employees' mood, motivation, and perceptions of efficacy.

2. SnackNation provided snacks as frequent, small rewards for their 100-person team. This helped bring the team together and boost morale.

3. Tailored, specific praise that includes positive words is most effective. Generic or vague praise has little impact. 

4. Frequent recognition and rewards can help reinforce core values and shape behavior. A New York hospital used regular praise and rewards to reduce late patient discharges.  

5. According to Gallup research, employees who receive regular recognition and praise are more satisfied, engaged and productive. But more than 50% of workers say they rarely or never receive recognition for doing good work.

In summary, the key takeaways from the chapter are that recognition works best when it is given frequently, specifically, and tailored to the individual. Small wins and regular praise can motivate employees more than large, infrequent rewards. But too many organizations fail to recognize good performance often enough.

 While the topic of ingratitude is not explored at length in the summary, here are some key takeaways:

• Many people have a "gratitude gap," meaning they do not express gratitude as often as they should or could. This can lead to ingratitude.

• There are myths that can prevent leaders from expressing gratitude to employees, such as thinking gratitude seems insincere or that only deserving employees should receive gratitude. Overcoming these myths is important.

• Simply expressing more gratitude can help combat ingratitude. Leaders are encouraged to praise employees often and without fear, tailor gratitude to individuals, and reinforce core values through gratitude. This can build a culture of appreciation in the workplace.

• Employees benefit from receiving gratitude through higher motivation, engagement, retention, and productivity. Gratitude also benefits the giver in feelings of joy and well-being.

• Practicing gratitude outside of work, through journals, rituals, and family discussions, can help individuals become more naturally grateful and less likely to be ingrates.

So in summary, while ingratitude itself is not examined, the article does explore how expressing more gratitude can help overcome ingratitude and create a more positive work environment and culture. Does this help summarize the key points around ingratitude in the summary? Let me know if you have any other questions.

 Here is a summary of the main points from the article:

• Leading without gratitude can be ineffective and demotivating for employees. Fear-based leadership and an attitude of ingratitude can damage company culture. 

• The article discusses various "myths" that leaders use to rationalize not showing gratitude, such as being too busy, believing money is the main motivator, or thinking employees don't deserve gratitude. 

• The author recommends that leaders model gratitude, praise employees often, and spot small wins that employees achieve. Expressing frequent appreciation can boost employee motivation and productivity.

• Peer-to-peer gratitude among employees, through recognition programs and social media, can improve teamwork and psychological safety. 

• Living a life of gratitude beyond the workplace, such as expressing gratitude to friends and family, can give leaders greater perspective and joy in their lives.

Does this look like a fair summary of the author's key points regarding leading with gratitude versus leading without it? Let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on any part of the summary.

 Here is a summary of the key points regarding aPS recognition at Zappos and social recognition apps:

• Zappos has a program called aPS (Super Nifty and Positive Stuff) which allows employees to recognize each other for positive behaviors through kudos cards and badges. It provides personalized recognition at scale.

• Social recognition apps help create a culture of gratitude and appreciation by making it easy for employees to recognize and thank each other. They provide instant feedback and visibility. 

• These types of programs can generate a virtuous circle where recognition leads to more motivated employees who then recognize others, fueling the cycle of positivity. 

• To be effective, social recognition should be tailored to the individual motivators and preferences of each employee. Generic recognition may not have as much impact.

• Public recognition through apps and programs can be effective, but it must be appropriate and not denigrating. The recognition should focus more on what the employee did rather than who they are.

In summary, social recognition apps and programs like aPS at Zappos can boost employee motivation and engagement by making it easy to recognize and thank colleagues. But the recognition must be tailored, specific, and appropriate to have maximum impact.
