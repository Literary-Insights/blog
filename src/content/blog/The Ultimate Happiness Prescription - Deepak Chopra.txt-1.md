- The passage discusses factors that contribute to happiness according to research, including conditions of living (C), voluntary activities (V), and biological/chemical factors. 

- Conditions of living like winning the lottery only account for 7-12% of happiness and effects are temporary. People adapt to circumstances. 

- Voluntary activities are about 50% of happiness. Activities that promote creative expression or help others tend to create deeper and more lasting happiness than those focused only on personal pleasure. 

- Biological factors like chemicals in the brain are also involved in regulating mood, but cannot ensure lasting happiness on their own. 

- Eastern traditions see suffering as inherent to human existence due to factors like impermanence, clinging to ego/identity, fear of change and death. 

- True and lasting happiness requires enlightenment - realizing one's true, transcendent identity beyond the physical self and ego. This cures suffering at its root by dispelling ignorance of one's true nature. 

- Enlightenment is finding the unchanging "ground state" amid all impermanence and change. It expands love/fulfillment rather than detaching one. Seven keys are provided to guide readers on this path.

 

The passage discusses the process of seeking enlightenment and becoming happier and more fulfilled. It states that seeking enlightenment gradually eliminates causes of unhappiness in life while also allowing innate happiness to blossom. 

It focuses on being aware of one's body as the first key to happiness. The body and mind form a single field of energy, information and consciousness. By listening to the body and responding with awareness, one taps into infinite possibilities where peace and joy are natural. 

It describes how the mind, body and spirit should feel united but often feel separate due to lack of awareness. Awareness tunes into every cell and regulates interactions, allowing mind and body to feel supported by each other. When in harmony, happiness results, while disharmony leads to unhappiness. 

The passage outlines three qualities of the field that support well-being - intelligence, creativity and power. It emphasizes that becoming more aware of one's body amplifies these qualities and connects one to infinite possibilities. Overall, the passage promotes becoming more aware of one's body as an important part of the process of seeking enlightenment and greater happiness.

 

- Shakti refers to an innate human ability to transform the invisible into the visible through imagination and manifestation. Whatever you imagine internally can manifest as external reality. 

- We are not passive observers of the universe but active cocreators. The universe expresses itself through us as awareness, and we know the universe through ourselves. 

- Our bodies transform the immense energy of the universe into a human scale. The small electric charge of a brain cell is the same fundamental energy as a whole galaxy. 

- Being aware, such as focusing on body sensations, unleashes intelligence, creativity and power within us. It allows healing by reconnecting with our natural self-regulating harmony. Stress and distraction break this connection. 

- Healing should be constant like breathing, through constant communication with the universal field via awareness of spaces between things, thoughts, breaths etc. This releases stored tension and stress, allowing the body to heal and refresh itself. 

- In a natural stress-free state, the body experiences happiness, lightness, stillness and a sense of eternal bliss consciousness through reconnecting with its core nature and the attributes of the divine - omniscience, omnipotence and omnipresence - at a cellular level.

 

- People confuse their self-image with their true selves. Our self-image is formed by identifying with external things like money, status, possessions, and other people's opinions. 

- This is called "object-referral" where we derive our identity from outside ourselves. The alternative is "self-referral" where we identify with our true inner being.

- Our true being is connected to all that exists, has no limitations, infinite creativity, is fearless and willing to step into the unknown. It can manifest our deepest desires through intention and synchronicity. 

- Identifying with our true being frees us, while object-referral traps us in insecurity as we pursue approval and fear disapproval to maintain our self-image. 

- The ego is insecure and derives its sense of worth from things like approval, control, security and power from others. This leaves us insecure and addicted to maintaining these things.

- We can shift to self-referral through awareness of how we currently derive identity, noticing old wounds and hurts no longer serve us, and surrendering to simplicity of being rather than ego's pursuit of an ideal self-image. Patience and awareness can help make this shift.

 

- Conditioning begins very early in life through interactions with caregivers, often as young as 1-3 years old. This sets lifelong patterns in the brain. 

- Common conditioning patterns involve manipulating others through being nice, nasty, stubborn, or playing the victim to get what we want. But this never leads to true happiness. 

- Conditioning creates a false sense of happiness and traps us in certain mental and emotional responses. 

- The root of toxicity and unhappiness often lies in subtle conditioning from the past that we are unaware of. 

- There is a 7 step process to detoxify from conditioning: 1) take responsibility, 2) witness your feelings, 3) label the feeling, 4) express the feeling, 5) share the feeling, 6) release through ritual, 7) celebrate the release and move on. 

- These steps can be applied to changing toxic emotions, habits, cravings or relationships by addressing the underlying conditioned responses from the past. The key is to witness feelings without judgment, expand perspective, and release bottled up energy through various means of expression and sharing.

 

- The initial reaction when confronting a difficult feeling or situation is often to contract one's perspective and focus solely on one's own point of view. 

- It is important to expand beyond this private perspective by sharing one's experience and seeking multiple points of view from a trusted listener. The aim is to gain a more holistic reflection rather than just defending one's own view.

- Performing a ritual, even a private symbolic one, can help purge or let go of toxic feelings. Creating and completing a meaningful ritual validates the release. 

- Celebrating the release through shared joy and gratitude helps honor the ending of one phase and beginning of another. This validates that one deserves to be free and happy. 

- Once begun, the detoxification process can be applied more broadly to simplify one's life by decluttering, spending on the environment, being generous, nourishing the body, and moving from complication to simplicity. 

- The key is recognizing and escaping old emotional conditioning patterns that cause suffering, which allows one to develop clarity and access life's infinite potential.

 

The passage discusses giving up the need to be right and judgments in order to experience greater peace, empathy and understanding. When you no longer feel the need to prove others wrong, you lose resentments and grievances that stem from making judgments. 

Instead of labels like "victim", the focus should be on realizing all people are connected through a shared consciousness of love and joy. Getting attached to anger and outrage over injustice prevents constructive action and adds more hostility to the world. 

True solutions come from a higher level of awareness than the problem. Righteousness and moral outrage do not solve problems, they only fuel more anger and antagonism. 

The ego is satisfied by always getting its way, having others agree with it, maintaining a sense of control and clearly defined notions of right and wrong. However, this comes at the cost of one's true self. 

True surrender and freedom comes from sharing one's deepest desires for love, safety, creative expression, joy and unity with another in a spiritual relationship. The commitment is to follow the shared path together, not any individual desires. This opens one to the mystery and fulfillment beyond the ego.

 

The passage talks about the importance of living in the present moment rather than being caught up in past or future. It says true happiness comes from being in the eternal now, free from the suffering that comes from thoughts about time. 

It discusses how time is subjective and relates to our thoughts and experiences. All unhappiness exists in time as our minds get caught up in evaluating experiences, comparing to others, building stories about our lives. 

To access a state of bliss and freedom, we must put our focus on the present rather than this constant mental activity. Living in the present means not identifying with changes and not using experiences to construct stories and self-images. It means realizing our true self lies beyond our thoughts and the changing world. 

Being present allows us to transcend situations, as situations are born and pass within the eternal now. The key is learning to be aware of the present moment rather than getting absorbed in our surroundings. This switches us from being a victim of time and change to discovering a state of peace and happiness in the timeless now.

 

- Many people's attention is dominated by thoughts of the past and future rather than being fully present in the current moment. They are not experiencing life to its fullest. 

- Mindfulness or paying attention in a special way can help cultivate presence. It involves stopping distracting mental activities like worrying, fantasizing, reliving memories, planning, etc. and simply observing what is happening in the present. 

- When the mind is restless, focus on sensations like breathing, sounds, body sensations, or movements. Anything that draws attention to the present moment. 

- Staying present requires not trying or using effort. Just notice when the mind gets distracted and return to presence. 

- Being present allows experiencing a calm, safe, loving joy. We often miss this due to constantly analyzing experiences rather than fully engaging with them. 

- True presence requires separating the situation from the present moment. Stressful situations are temporary but we remain. If needed, remove yourself from situations to reconnect with presence. 

- The inner world reflects the outer world, as both are mirrors created by one's own level of consciousness. Changing your beliefs about consciousness can shift both worlds to one of greater happiness, love and abundance.

 

- The passage discusses the highest levels of human consciousness - being, feeling, thinking and doing. It argues that when these levels are properly aligned and connected to one's "pure being", they lead to the deepest human values of loving kindness, compassion, joy and equanimity. 

- It explains how disconnected inner events (hopes, wishes etc.) from the outer world response leads to unfulfillment. Restoring the proper sequence from being to feeling to thinking to doing solves this. 

- Living from one's pure being means basing thoughts and actions on genuine feelings that spring from the deepest self. This ensures inner and outer reality will reflect who you truly are. 

- It advocates becoming mindful of one's "true self" or witness role to act from the highest level of consciousness even in difficult situations. Observing the breath can help achieve stillness and access deeper feelings of love and compassion. 

- Acting from this place of highest consciousness means the consequences of one's actions will benefit all people in any given situation, even if indirectly or over time. The obligation is simply to execute the sequential unfolding of consciousness at its purest levels.

 

- Traditions speak of enlightenment, but it can only truly be experienced individually by making a life decision to shift one's focus and pursuit from happiness to bliss. 

- Moments of intense happiness or ecstasy can happen spontaneously when the ego's clouds clear, but actively seeking enlightenment requires a willful shift. 

- This shift seems threatening to most because enlightenment became associated with renunciation, sacrifice, poverty, and solitude, which is a false belief. True enlightenment is discovering one's true self, not a form of sacrifice. 

- Through mindfulness, one can witness what the ego tries to hide - that daily life is unfulfilling when the deepest desire is blocked. 

- A simple exercise of imagining a sunset illustrates that all experiences exist in consciousness, not the brain. The body, world, and sense experiences also exist only in consciousness. 

- Ultimately, one must realize they are pure consciousness without location in time/space. Consciousness causes the brain and holds the world together simply through observation. 

- Progress on the path is indicated by life flowing with effortless spontaneity, love as a motivation, access to creativity/imagination, accepting higher guidance, and choices that benefit oneself and others through expanding happiness. 

- The journey is a progression from ordinary to soul to cosmic to divine to unity consciousness, realizing all is part of infinity and eternity. Enlightenment is the natural expansion and destination as one's true home and blissful birthright.

 

The passage discusses moving beyond an outdated view of happiness that can lead to unforeseen problems. Previously, happiness was defined through things like material possessions or activities without considering their long-term impacts. 

It argues we are all interconnected through the constant sharing of atoms, particles, thoughts, emotions, etc. across bodies and environments. Everything circulates as part of one process. Realizing this interdependence can help shift our awareness away from a sense of separation and competition toward greater coherence and happiness. 

True, enduring happiness depends on not exploiting or ignoring others. Coherent, aware individuals who find inner peace can radiate positive influences and help alleviate chaos in the world. Since emotions and physical states are mirrored between people, one person's happiness can start a "healing response" in others through emotional and biological contagion. 

Rather than a limited self-identity, we should see ourselves on a global scale as part of humanity's extended mind/body. Spreading happiness widely has the potential to heal problems on a worldwide level by creating greater unity, order, and well-being everywhere. The passage advocates cultivating happiness as the most impactful way to positively influence the world.
