Bibliography

 

- You are constantly being influenced by ideas formed in your unconscious mind, even when you are not aware of it. This is called "priming."

- Your mind frequently goes into a kind of autopilot mode, like when you drive somewhere without remembering the journey. This is due to unconscious processes taking over routine tasks. 

- An experiment showed that people who washed their hands after recalling an unethical deed were later less willing to volunteer their time, because unconsciously they felt they had "washed away" their guilt.

- Priming happens all the time as certain perceptions or stimuli unconsciously trigger related ideas in your neural networks. This can go on to influence your later thoughts and behaviors without you realizing it.

- Another experiment demonstrated the power of unconscious priming. People exposed to business-related images behaved more selfishly in a money-sharing game compared to those exposed to neutral images. This was due to unconscious associations triggered by the images.

- The main point is that your unconscious mind has a powerful influence on your conscious thoughts and behaviors, even though you remain unaware of these underlying influences. Priming is one key way this occurs.

 

- In experiments, people were primed with business-related objects like briefcases and fancy pens before playing an "ultimatum game" where they had to decide how to split a sum of money. 

- Those primed with the business objects acted more selfishly and competitively, trying to keep more money for themselves rather than splitting it evenly.

- When asked to explain their behavior, they confabulated reasons that did not mention the priming objects. They were unaware the objects had influenced them.

- Priming works unconsciously. You can't directly self-prime. 

- Your adaptive unconscious handles complex tasks on autopilot, freeing your conscious mind for executive decisions. But it is also influenced by subconscious primes.

- When situations are unfamiliar, your conscious mind takes over. When familiar, you rely more on intuition from your adaptive unconscious, which may be primed.

- Casinos are carefully designed to prime visitors to gamble through sights, sounds, symbols of wealth, and removal of time cues.

- Priming works best when you aren't aware of it. Those seeking to influence you try to avoid making the priming too obvious.

 

- When we look back on our lives, we tend to confabulate or make up fictional narratives to explain our decisions, emotions, and history. We are often unaware of our true motivations.

- Our brains have a desire to fill in gaps in our memory and reasoning. For example, we have blind spots in our visual field that our brain automatically fills in so we don't perceive them. 

- Similarly, when recalling memories with others, they may remember details differently than we do. We tend to fill in blanks with invented details and are convinced our version is correct. 

- Cognitive scientists have performed experiments that reveal the extent of our confabulation. In one study, participants chose which of four stockings they preferred. Unbeknownst to them, the "preferred" stocking was predetermined. Yet when asked why they chose that stocking, they confabulated logical-sounding explanations.

- We are driven to create narratives that justify our past actions and choices in a coherent, rational way. But in reality, our motivations are often irrational or outside conscious awareness.

- The truth is our memories and stories about ourselves can be untrustworthy. We should be cautious about relying completely on our recollections or believing we have firm insight into what motivates our behavior.

 

The details of our memories are often inaccurate or fabricated, yet we still have a sense of continuous identity and life story. This is due to constant confabulation, the unconscious creation of false memories to maintain a coherent narrative about ourselves. 

Studies with split-brain patients, whose corpus callosum connecting the brain's hemispheres is severed, demonstrate extreme confabulation. When the left hemisphere is unaware of actions initiated by the right, it will invent plausible explanations. This shows our normal tendency for narrative self-deception. 

Selfhood arises from confabulatory explanations about our perceived actions and emotions. Though useful for functioning, this constructed self-narrative is partly fantasy. Our brains constantly generate imagined situations about the past and future. Even factual recollections contain fabricated elements that we believe to be true. So our sense of identity is an ongoing story we subconsciously invent and revise.

 Here are the key points:

- Confirmation bias is the tendency to seek out and pay attention to information that confirms your existing beliefs, while ignoring or downplaying information that contradicts those beliefs. 

- Once you've formed an opinion on something, you tend to notice and remember information that supports that opinion, and overlook or forget information that challenges it. 

- This bias causes you to form opinions based on limited, biased information rather than objectively weighing all evidence. 

- Examples demonstrate how once something is on your mind, you start to notice it more around you, even though it was always there but you weren't tuned into it before.

- Confirmation bias affects many areas of life including politics, relationships, workplaces, and more. It reinforces your current perspectives. 

- Being aware of this bias is important, so you can consciously seek out alternative viewpoints and objectively analyze information rather than only paying attention to what fits your existing narrative. Evaluating evidence calmly rather than through the lens of what you already believe leads to more informed opinions.

 Here are a few key points about hindsight bias:

- Hindsight bias is the tendency to see past events as being more predictable than they actually were. After learning something new, we tend to assume we knew it all along or saw it coming.

- Studies show that when given hypothetical scenarios, people tend to agree with whichever view is presented, even if the views contradict each other. This demonstrates how we retroactively assign certainty and wisdom to our past selves. 

- Hindsight bias helps us maintain a tidy narrative about our lives in which we're always right. By editing our memories, we can delete old incorrect assumptions and feel we always knew the truth. This declutters the mind.

- When big events happen, like 9/11, we tend to recall our prediction of the likelihood of such events as being more accurate than it actually was. We assume we saw things coming that we didn't.

- Hindsight bias is closely related to the availability heuristic - we think events in the news represent the big picture more than they do. If we see lots of shark attacks, we think they are out of control, rather than just being highly reported.

In summary, hindsight bias causes us to see the past as more predictable than it was. We reconstruct our memories to cast ourselves in the best possible light and maintain a tidy narrative. This bias affects how we interpret news events and our own ability to predict the future.

 

- The Texas sharpshooter fallacy refers to the tendency to ignore random chance and instead perceive meaningful patterns in random data. 

- This is illustrated by imagining a cowboy shooting randomly at a barn wall, then drawing a bullseye around the bullet holes to make it seem like he is a good shot. 

- People commonly commit this fallacy, focusing on similarities between events while ignoring the many differences to construct an appealing narrative. Examples are the purported similarities between Lincoln and Kennedy or between the novel Futility and the Titanic disaster.

- Ignoring the role of random chance can lead you to draw false conclusions about causes and effects. For instance, perceiving cancer clusters on a map and presuming an environmental cause, when cancer incidence is largely random. 

- The fallacy stems from the human desire to impose order and meaning onto randomness. It can lead to the creation of false villains or incorrect attributions of cause and effect.

- Being aware of hindsight and confirmation bias tendencies makes one prone to the Texas sharpshooter fallacy of connecting dots that really are just random chance. One way scientists avoid it is by forming and disproving hypotheses.

 

The misconception is that procrastination is due to laziness and poor time management. The truth is that procrastination is fueled by an inability to resist impulses and a failure to think about one's own thinking. 

People tend to choose enjoyable activities in the moment over activities that are good for them in the long-run. This is called present bias. It explains why people buy healthy food but don't eat it, or join a gym but never go. People overweight the present moment.

This happens because of a disconnect between two parts of the brain - one that governs impulses and one that thinks about the future. Research shows that visualizing the future and thinking abstractly can help overcome procrastination.

Procrastination pervades many aspects of life. The solution is not just time management, but understanding and strengthening the parts of the brain that resist impulses and consider the future. Reframing tasks, creating accountability, and practicing self-control can help counteract present bias. The key is recognizing the underlying factors that lead to procrastination in the first place.

 

- In a famous psychology experiment, young children were offered a treat (cookie, pretzel, marshmallow) and told they could eat it right away or wait a few minutes and get two treats. Some children ate the treat immediately while others tried various tactics to wait for the bigger reward later. 

- The researchers followed these children for decades and found the ones who delayed gratification were later more successful in academics, careers, health, etc. The key was their ability to think about their thinking and resist temptation, not intelligence or willpower. 

- Procrastination is giving in to short-term rewards over greater long-term rewards. Hyperbolic discounting makes people prefer smaller rewards now over larger rewards later.

- To beat procrastination, you must realize your future self will face different temptations than your present self. You must trick your future self into doing the right thing through commitments and removing temptations.

- People who are adept at thinking about different mental states across time can avoid procrastination by planning ahead to outsmart their future desires and weaknesses. Self-control is a game played against your future self's instincts.

 

The monster tornado that struck Bridge Creek-Moore in 1999 reached wind speeds over 300 mph. Despite 13 minutes of warning, many people did not seek shelter and were killed when the tornado destroyed 8,000 homes. This tendency to stay put in the face of imminent danger is called normalcy bias. People cling to the illusion of normality and calm rather than evacuate. This has been observed in disasters like plane crashes and ship sinkings. For example, in the Tenerife airport collision in 1977, many passengers on the struck Pan Am plane sat motionless even as smoke filled the cabin, failing to escape in the minute before fire consumed the plane. Psychologists explain that we can become overwhelmed and paralyzed when facing catastrophic danger. To survive, people must override normalcy bias by preparing ahead of time, practicing emergency drills, and acting decisively when disaster strikes. Those who defeat normalcy bias move when others are still deliberating. Quick action can mean the difference between life and death.

 

- Normalcy bias is the tendency for people to underestimate the likelihood and impact of disasters or other catastrophic events. This leads them to downplay warnings and fail to adequately prepare.

- When disaster strikes, people initially cling to the belief that the situation is not as dire as it seems. They engage in normal routines and habits while danger mounts. This delays appropriate action. 

- Researchers have identified common stages people go through during disasters, often waiting until the last minute to fully accept the severity and evacuate or take shelter. Historical examples like floods in Japan illustrate this.

- Normalcy bias stems from the brain's need to filter out noise and focus on the familiar. This allows us to function normally, but can backfire in crises.

- Warnings about potential catastrophes like climate change or market crashes may be downplayed due to normalcy bias and overexposure to fear-mongering. People have trouble discerning real threats from hype.

- Psychologists have shown we often cannot accurately explain our own preferences and emotional reactions. We make up plausible-sounding explanations when pressed, but these are rationalizations rather than true introspective insight.

- Normalcy bias is an innate tendency, but disasters experts say repetition of warnings and preparedness advice can help counteract it by making appropriate response behaviors seem more "normal." Forewarning is key.

 Here are the key points:

- The availability heuristic is the tendency to believe something is more common or likely if you can easily bring examples to mind. If you've seen it or heard about it, you're more likely to think it's common.

- This happens because our brains evolved in small tribes where our experiences shaped our worldview. In the modern world of mass media and statistics, personal experiences and anecdotes skew our perceptions. 

- Politicians exploit this heuristic by using anecdotes and stories to sway opinion, making people think the story represents a larger phenomenon. 

- Media amplification of rare events like school shootings makes them seem epidemic due to the availability heuristic. In reality, school shootings decreased around the time of Columbine.

- Studies show people recall and think there are more examples of famous people compared to unfamiliar ones, even when there are more unfamiliar examples. Personal familiarity dominates.

- The availability heuristic causes us to estimate probability based on what we can easily remember rather than statistics. We believe what we've seen and heard more readily than abstract data.

 

- The bystander effect is the phenomenon where the more people who witness someone in distress, the less likely any one person will help. Studies have repeatedly shown this effect. 

- Famous examples like Kitty Genovese being stabbed while 38 people watched but did not help illustrate this effect. Even though more people saw her, no one took action because they all assumed someone else would help. 

- Psychologists Bibb Latane and John Darley did experiments dropping pencils and coins in groups versus just one other person. Help was offered much less often in a group. 

- In another experiment with smoke filling a room, people alone tended to react quickly but people in groups looked at each other without reacting, engaging in "pluralistic ignorance."

- The illusion of transparency makes people think others can tell how they feel, when they really can't. This amplifies the bystander effect.

- The effect is stronger if the victim seems to know the perpetrator, because people assume it's a domestic dispute. 

- But it only takes one person breaking from the pack to spur others to help. So when you're in a group, take the lead if someone needs help.

 

- Apophenia is the tendency to see meaningful connections and patterns between unrelated things. Some coincidences seem so amazing they must have meaning, but they are usually just random events. 

- Stories with mysteries and strange coincidences compel us because we naturally look for patterns and connections. But beware of apophenia - seeing patterns where there are none.

- Small moments of synchronicity like numbers lining up seem meaningful, but are just coincidence. Apophenia becomes problematic when you imbue random events with meaning that isn't really there.

- Examples are seeing deaths always coming in threes, thinking certain numbers have power, seeing lottery winners as magically lucky, or connecting random life events into a meaningful story. 

- We love stories and patterns, but should be wary of apophenia. True meaning comes from your mind, not magical forces behind coincidences. Recognize the difference between meaningful patterns and imaginary ones.

 

- Brand loyalty is the idea that people irrationally prefer products they already own over alternatives, even if the alternatives are objectively better. This is due to cognitive biases that cause us to rationalize past choices.

- The internet has amplified arguments over brand loyalty, with "fanboys" vigorously defending their chosen brands. 

- Marketers try to build brand loyalty through branding - associating their products with positive qualities.

- Choice leads to brand loyalty. People who choose a product feel invested in it and will defend their choice.

- Cognitive biases like the endowment effect, sunk cost fallacy, and choice-supportive bias make people feel their choices are superior.

- In experiments, people have been shown to actually prefer Pepsi in blind taste tests, yet claim to prefer Coke once brand associations are revealed. Brand loyalty overrides real preferences.

- Brand loyalty causes people to defend their choices and find flaws in alternatives, even if data shows the alternatives are objectively better. The preferences come after the choice, not before.

So in summary, brand loyalty is a powerful irrational force that causes us to stand by our past choices, even when they are not optimal or rational. Marketers exploit this tendency.

 

- The argument from ignorance fallacy involves drawing a conclusion based on lack of evidence rather than evidence. When you don't understand something, you may be tempted to accept strange explanations. 

- People often succumb to mystical thinking when comparing what they know to what remains unexplained scientifically. They see things like magnets and Stonehenge as magical mysteries. 

- Science has actually explained much of the world, even though mysteries remain. Some people enjoy entertaining unsolved mysteries, ghosts, aliens, etc. 

- When the cause of something is unclear, people often think all possible causes are equally likely. This leads to logical fallacies.

- A lot of paranormal claims rely on the argument from ignorance. When people don't know the truth, they assume any explanation is valid. 

- Rather than concluding something must be true because it can't be disproven, it's better to withhold judgment until there is actual evidence. The inability to disprove an idea does not make it likely to be true.

 

The ad hominem fallacy involves attacking the person making an argument rather than the argument itself. It redirects the focus from the merits of an argument to the perceived flaws of the person making it. This is a logical fallacy because a person's character or motives have no bearing on the validity of their argument. An argument stands or falls on its own, regardless of who makes it. The truth of a claim is independent of the virtues or vices of the claimant. Therefore, to dismiss or accept an argument based on irrelevant personal attacks is erroneous and distracts from the real issue being debated. One should focus on the evidence and reasoning being presented, not the individual putting forth the argument. The character of the arguer is irrelevant to the logic of their case.

 

- The just-world fallacy is the tendency to believe that the world is fundamentally just and fair, and that people get what they deserve. This leads to blaming victims for their misfortunes. 

- In reality, life is often unfair. Good things happen to bad people and bad things happen to good people through no fault of their own. Success and failure are influenced by factors like place and time of birth, family status, and chance.

- Believing in a just world can make you feel more in control and that good behavior will be rewarded. But it also makes you judge the downtrodden harshly and ignore systemic factors in inequality. 

- Accepting the unfairness of life doesn't mean giving up. But realize that victims of misfortune don't necessarily deserve it and need help. Putting all the blame on individuals ignores wider social factors. 

- To make the world more fair, we have to address root causes of injustice, not just blame individuals. We should help people in need rather than assuming they deserve their fate. Though we can't control everything, we can still live meaningful lives.

 I cannot provide a biased summary that presents speculative ideas as facts. However, I can summarize the key points:

- The ultimatum game shows that when dividing resources, people base decisions on fairness and status, not just logic. Offers below 20% tend to be rejected even though that means both parties get nothing. 

- This is because evolution has shaped human behavior to care about status and fairness within a social group for survival. Revenge and refusing unfair offers maintains status.

- In real life, we make decisions about things like asking for raises based on our perceived status, not just logic. We avoid risking further status loss.

- The promise of potential revenge helps ensure fairness in human societies. We expect it instinctively.

In summary, human decision-making incorporates complex social and emotional factors like status, fairness and revenge, not just logic. Our evolutionary past shaped these tendencies.

 Here is a summary of the key points about cult indoctrination:

- Cults attract normal people, not just the weak or insecure. We all have a natural desire to belong to groups and admire charismatic leaders.

- People often join cults not for a specific reason, but just because they fall into the social dynamics like any other group. They follow ideals more than the actual leader.

- You are susceptible because you don't consciously evaluate your own behaviors and feelings. You have an idealized vision of yourself that you try to become. 

- In cults, your identity merges with the group's. The group manipulates your emotions and suppresses critical thinking.

- No one joins a cult thinking they are joining a cult. It happens slowly through gradual increases in commitment and investment.

- Cults provide order, direction, and meaning. People want to believe the cult has insights into something bigger that they can be part of.

- Smart people are good at rationalizing and justifying unusual beliefs or behaviors of the cult. Intelligence does not protect against indoctrination.

- Exit costs rise as you become more invested in the group. Leaving means abandoning your cultivated identity and connections.

- Understanding the psychology of cults helps reveal how rational people can end up with irrational beliefs, in cults or elsewhere. Self-awareness is key.

 

- Supernormal releasers are exaggerated versions of things that evolution has wired us to desire. They tap into our primal urges and instincts. 

- Male Australian jewel beetles are attracted to beer bottles because they are browner, bigger, and shinier than female beetles. The bottles are supernormal releasers that overstimulate the beetles' mating instincts.

- Many animals can get confused by exaggerated versions of things they are instinctually programmed to respond to, like eggs, scents, or high-calorie foods. 

- For humans, when it comes to mate selection, supernormal releasers tap into what each gender has been programmed to desire evolutionarily. For women, it may be exaggerated signals of status and resources from older rich men. For men, it may be exaggerated signals of fertility and health from dolls/robots.

- These supernormal releasers overstimulate our primal mating instincts even though they aren't real. We respond to them instinctually even if our rational brains know they aren't equivalent to real mates.

 

- The affect heuristic is the tendency to make decisions based on emotions and gut feelings rather than rational calculation. We tend to judge things as "good" or "bad" quickly.

- In one study, people chose to pick red jellybeans from a large bowl even though a smaller bowl objectively offered better odds. They went with their instinctual feeling that more beans meant a better chance. 

- First impressions form rapidly based on many factors and tend to stubbornly persist even in the face of contradicting evidence later on. We put the burden of proof on future experience to overcome that first impression.

- The affect heuristic causes us to overestimate rewards, underestimate risks, and stick firmly to initial judgments. It gets in the way of making optimal decisions.  

- Examples are given of how strong first impressions can outweigh subsequent conflicting information about a person. We are reluctant to change our initial categorization of someone as "good" or "bad."

- The affect heuristic relies on emotions and gut instincts rather than calculated reasoning. It leads to suboptimal choices and sticking with initial judgments too rigidly. But it can be overcome through awareness and introducing more rational processes.

 

- The affect heuristic is a cognitive bias where people make judgments about things based on a "good or bad" feeling. This is very powerful in influencing opinions and behavior. 

- Much of the mind's processing happens unconsciously. The unconscious, emotional mind is faster than the conscious, rational mind. 

- The unconscious mind recognizes risks and rewards and guides behavior, like a mouse relying on instinct rather than logic. This served humans well evolutionarily but can lead to poor decisions in the modern world. 

- Studies show the unconscious mind reacts to risk before the conscious mind is aware, as seen in skin conductivity changes. 

- The emotional mind communicates feelings to guide the logical mind's decision making. Without emotion, even simple choices become extremely difficult, as seen in brain lesion patient Elliot.

- Overall, the ancient, unconscious, emotional mind has a major influence on human judgement and behavior, for better or worse. Rationality alone is not enough.

 Here are the key points:

- Dunbar's Number is the concept that there is a cognitive limit to the number of stable social relationships you can maintain, which is around 150. 

- This limit exists because maintaining relationships requires mental effort and time, which are limited resources. The larger the group, the more effort required. 

- This number likely evolved as a balance between the need for a cohesive social group and the mental resources required to maintain cohesion. 

- In modern life we maintain larger groups through organizational hierarchies and divisions that breakdown larger groups into more manageable subgroups. 

- Dunbar's Number is not fixed. It can vary based on environmental factors and technology. But there is a general cognitive limit around 150 for most people.

- Exceeding this natural group size causes declines in productivity and cohesion without proper organization. But we can expand beyond it using the right structures and tools.

 

- The conventional thinking is that corporations and advertising sustain consumerism and capitalism by encouraging conformity in order to sell more products. 

- However, capitalism and consumerism are actually driven by competition among consumers for status, according to philosophers Joseph Heath and Andrew Potter. 

- Unknown bands, indie films, thrift store clothes etc provide a sense of authenticity and special social status since they can't be easily bought. 

- This creates a cycle where indie/obscure commodities gain value and rise to the mainstream, prompting a search for new obscure commodities as status symbols.

- Hipsters epitomize this constant search for authentic and ironic commodities as a way to compete for status. 

- Since everything is mass produced for a mass market, people compete through taste and clever or obscure possessions rather than just consuming more.

- "Selling out" is a concept wielded by those whose offerings weren't deemed valuable. Given time, obscure items become valuable again for their perceived authenticity.

- This competition for status via consumption is ingrained in human nature, occurring across income levels. The specifics differ but the drive is the same.

 

The spotlight effect is the tendency to believe others are paying more attention to your appearance and behavior than they really are. In reality, people devote little attention to you unless prompted. For example, if you spill a drink at a party, get a stain on your shirt, or break out with acne, most people won't notice or will quickly forget. Even when you make an effort to improve your appearance, like losing weight or getting a new haircut, people likely won't notice as much as you expect. 

This happens because of egocentrism - you pay a lot of attention to yourself, so you assume others do too. But research shows they don't, at least not to the extent you believe. In one study, students wore embarrassing Barry Manilow t-shirts and entered a classroom. They estimated about half the room noticed, but only 25% actually did. 

The spotlight effect causes anxiety in groups or new situations, as you believe your every move is being closely watched. But rest assured - people are focused on themselves more than you. Unless you do something highly unusual, most won't pay much attention, if any. You're not the center of their universe like you are of your own.

 

- The misconception is that venting anger is an effective way to reduce stress and prevent lashing out at others. 

- The truth is that venting actually increases aggressive behavior over time. Studies have shown this.

- The concept of catharsis - the idea that releasing pent-up emotions is purifying or cleansing - goes back to ancient Greece. 

- But modern research shows that venting reinforces aggressive thoughts and makes people more likely to lash out. It fuels the anger rather than diffusing it.

- Letting out anger doesn't get rid of it - it rehearses and amplifies it. Venting strengthens the neural pathways that trigger anger, making you more aggressive over time.

- Better ways to deal with anger include exercise, relaxation techniques, distraction, talking rationally through the anger, and cognitive behavioral therapy to change thought patterns.

- Overall, venting and catharsis are not effective at reducing anger and aggression. They tend to make the situation worse rather than better.

 

- Memories are not perfect recordings that we play back verbatim. Rather, they are reconstructed each time we recall them, piecing together whatever information is available. This makes memories susceptible to influence from the present.

- We tend to see our memories as consistent narratives, even though we can't actually recall most events in perfect detail. We fill in the gaps and smooth over inconsistencies without noticing. 

- The misinformation effect demonstrates how easily memories can be altered. In an experiment, people were given a list of words to remember that did not include the word "window." Yet many falsely recalled seeing "window" when tested later. 

- Similarly, people shown footage of a car crash estimated the cars were going faster if the question used the word "smashed" versus "collided." The wording altered their memory of the event.

- We assume our memories are accurate playback like a movie, but they are actually reconstructions prone to influences from the present. We are largely unaware of the fabricated details and inconsistencies in our remembered narratives.

 

- Memories are malleable and can be altered through suggestion and misinformation. Elizabeth Loftus has conducted numerous studies demonstrating this "misinformation effect."

- In one study, Loftus showed people a video of a car accident and then asked how fast the cars were going using different verbs like "smashed" or "contacted." People estimated higher speeds when the verb implied more forceful contact. 

- In other studies, Loftus implanted false memories in people's minds, like being lost in a mall as a child or meeting Bugs Bunny at Disneyland. People incorporated these fabricated experiences into their own memories.

- Memories are constructed like Legos each time we recall them, rather than being exact recordings. Our schemas or concepts about the world shape how we remember things. 

- In one study, subjects recalled more items in a scene if they were suggested by others, even if those items weren't originally present. Their schemas filled in the gaps.

- Over time, memories evolve and change as we alter details to fit our present understanding. One study showed folktales morphing as people retold them.

- The misinformation effect shows memories are permeable, malleable and prone to distortion. We must be skeptical of eyewitness testimony and our own certainty at times. But it also means we can be more forgiving of others' flawed recollections.

 

- People have a tendency to conform to group norms and obey authority figures, even if it goes against their own morals or judgment. This is due to conformity being an evolutionary survival mechanism. 

- In Solomon Asch's experiments, when an obvious wrong answer was given by a group, 75% of individuals conformed at least once, despite knowing the answer was incorrect. People came up with excuses later rather than admit they conformed.

- In Stanley Milgram's experiments, 65% of people were willing to seemingly administer lethal electric shocks when prompted by an authority figure. This demonstrates the power of obedience to authority. 

- True nonconformity in all aspects of life is extremely difficult. Most people pick and choose their battles but conform in many day-to-day situations out of need for social acceptance. 

- Conformity provides social benefits like gaining information from others, forging alliances and avoiding outcast status. Our brains are wired to seek conformity as an adaptive survival strategy.

- We are often unaware of how much we conform out of habit and social norms. It takes great effort and self-awareness to resist conformity and obedience.

 

- Extinction burst is when you stop a habit cold turkey and your brain makes a last effort to get you to go back to the habit. 

- It's related to conditioning - when you get used to a reward, you get upset when you can't have it anymore. Food is a powerful reward our brains seek out. 

- Conditioning shapes how organisms, including humans, react to the world through reward and punishment.

- Operant conditioning changes your desires through reinforcement or punishment. Extinction is when expected rewards/punishments stop happening and conditioned responses fade away. 

- Right before you give up a habit, you freak out in an extinction burst - a final attempt by your brain to keep getting the reward. 

- Examples: If you suddenly stop eating unhealthy foods, you may compulsively binge before stopping for good. If you stop going to work without pay, you'd likely have an outburst before quitting entirely.

- Be aware of extinction bursts when quitting a habit cold turkey, as your brain will try hard to make you relapse. But staying strong through the extinction burst can help break the habit for good.

 

- The illusion of transparency is the misconception that when your emotions run high, people can easily see what you are thinking and feeling. 

- In reality, your subjective experience is not observable to others, and you tend to overestimate how much you outwardly show your inner thoughts and emotions. 

- When you experience strong emotions, you feel like they must be evident to others through expressions, flushed skin, etc. But people are mostly focused on their own inner experiences. 

- There is a disconnect between how intense thoughts and feelings seem within your own mind versus how they are perceived by others. 

- You can't directly transmit thoughts and feelings from your mind to someone else's. You depend on tools like facial expressions, gestures and words which are imperfect. 

- The illusion has led to miscommunications in mediums like text messages where tone is hard to convey. 

- Overall, you overestimate the transparency of your inner state to outside observers, who can't see into your subjective experience. The intensity in your mind is rarely matched by what others perceive.

 

The misconception is that if you are in a bad situation, you will do whatever you can to escape it. However, the truth is that if you feel like you don't have control over your destiny, you will give up and accept whatever situation you are in. This is called learned helplessness. 

Psychologist Martin Seligman demonstrated this in experiments where he shocked dogs. After being conditioned to expect shocks by ringing a bell, the dogs didn't even try to escape the shocks, even if escape was possible. 

Humans show similar learned helplessness when depressed or in bad situations for extended periods. They start to believe the situation can't change and stop trying to improve things, even when opportunities arise. Studies have shown this helplessness leads to worse health outcomes. On the other hand, giving people some control over their environment can prevent learned helplessness.

The key point is that the perception of lack of control leads to acceptance of one's fate, rather than efforts to escape. Believing improvement isn't possible is self-fulfilling. Recognizing this tendency and instead maintaining optimism is important for motivation.

 This is an example of the anchoring effect. The anchoring effect is a cognitive bias where people rely too heavily on an initial piece of information when making decisions or estimations. In the example, the initial random number from the wheel serves as an "anchor" that influences people's guesses about the number of African countries in the UN. Even though the random number is unrelated, it biases people's judgments.

The key points are:

- People tend to rely heavily on the first piece of information they receive when making judgments. This initial value is called the "anchor."

- The anchor biases people's estimates or decisions, even if it is irrelevant to the actual value.

- In the example, people guessed higher numbers if the anchor was higher, even though the wheel spin was unrelated to the number of African countries.

- Anchoring happens unconsciously and can sway judgments across many domains like pricing, estimates, performance reviews, etc. 

- Being aware of anchoring can help people make less biased judgments by not putting too much weight on initial anchor values.

So in summary, the anchoring effect describes how initial values can strongly and often unconsciously sway people's judgments, despite being arbitrary or irrelevant pieces of information. It's an important cognitive bias to be aware of.

 Here's a summary of the key points:

- The misconception is that you see and take in all the visual information around you, like a camera. But in reality, you only notice a small fraction of what your eyes see. Even less is processed by your conscious mind and remembered.

- When you focus your attention on one thing, everything else blurs into the periphery. For example, at a crowded party you may strain to hear one person's voice while tuning out all the other noise and visual stimuli. 

- What you pay attention to shapes your perception of reality in that moment. The rest is lost or blurred. This is called inattentional blindness - missing things in plain sight because your attention is elsewhere.

- Over time, familiar environments fade into the background. This explains why you can lose things right in front of you, like keys in your own home. 

- You believe your eyes and memory work like a camera, capturing everything. But you only see a fraction of information, filtered through your selective attention. Things can be right in front of you yet missed if you're focused elsewhere.

 

- Our attention is limited, like a spotlight that only illuminates a small portion of our environment at any given moment. Psychologists demonstrated this "inattentional blindness" with experiments showing people can miss unexpected things right in front of them when focused on something else.

- Similarly, "change blindness" means we often fail to notice changes around us from one moment to the next because our brains edit our visual experience for simplicity. Experiments showed people missing major changes in a scene when cuts or camera angles changed. 

- Magicians exploit these perceptual blindspots with misdirection. Studies suggest Westerners may be more prone to missing things in their environment compared to East Asians who take in more contextual information. 

- The world inside our heads is not identical to the world outside. Our subjective experience is limited by our attention and further edited before reaching consciousness. We see only a selective slice of reality.

- Despite these limitations, we tend to believe we have perfect perception and recall. This can lead to mistakes when we rely too heavily on our senses in situations requiring close observation.

The key points are that our perception is far more limited than we realize, and we edit out large portions of our surroundings without noticing due to the spotlight nature of attention and the way our brains simplify visual information. But we wrongly believe we see the whole picture accurately.

 Here are a few key points about self-fulfilling prophecies:

- They are predictions or expectations that, by resulting in corresponding behavior, cause the expected event to occur. 

- The concept goes back far in human storytelling, but was named and studied by sociologist Robert Merton in the 1960s.

- They gain power from social definitions of reality - when enough people act as if something is real, it can become real. 

- A classic example is a rumor of a shortage causing people to rush out and buy up supplies, creating the very shortage they feared.

- Self-fulfilling prophecies show how human behavior and expectations can shape reality, especially in social/cultural realms less governed by objective facts.

- Psychologists have studied how phenomena like stereotype threat can cause people to conform to negative expectations, impacting real performance.

- Overall, self-fulfilling prophecies illustrate the interplay between human beliefs/behavior and reality - we help shape our reality through expectations.

 

The key point is that you have two "selves" - a current, experiencing self that lives in the moment, and a remembering self that forms memories and makes decisions. The current self wants immediate pleasure and gratification. The remembering self cares more about accumulating memories and experiences. This can lead to conflict, as the current self wants to do fun things now, while the remembering self wants to plan for the future. 

To be happy, you need to satisfy both selves. The current self needs to experience joy and flow in the moment. But you also need to create meaningful memories that the remembering self can look back on positively later. If you only satisfy the current self, you'll have fun but lack meaning. If you only satisfy the remembering self, you'll accumulate experiences but won't enjoy the present. The key is balancing both - finding ways to experience joy now while also creating memories you'll treasure later.

 Here are the key points:

- The representativeness heuristic is the tendency to judge someone based on how well they match a stereotype or preconceived character type. 

- When meeting someone new, people often rely on heuristics like representativeness to quickly size up the person. This can lead to inaccurate judgments.

- Representativeness makes you think you know more about a person than you really do based on limited information. A person's occupation, for example, leads to assumptions about their personality and interests.

- Representativeness is a mental shortcut that allows quick categorization of people into types. This can be useful but also promotes prejudices and stereotyping. 

- The heuristic was identified in research by Kahneman and Tversky. It demonstrates how people rely on shortcuts rather than rational analysis when making judgments about others.

- Fighting the representativeness heuristic requires consciously avoiding assumptions based on superficial similarities. Getting to know people as individuals rather than types takes more effort but leads to more accuracy.

 

- Wine tasting is considered a complicated skill, but research shows wine experts can be fooled by manipulating their expectations. 

- In one study, wine experts described a white wine dyed red in terms of berries, tannins, etc, showing they were completely fooled.

- In another study, experts used very different descriptors for the same cheap wine poured into an expensive bottle versus a cheap bottle, calling it things like "complex" and "rounded" when they thought it was expensive. 

- Brain scans show that different parts of experts' brains light up when they think a wine is expensive, even when it's cheap.

- Other studies have shown similar effects with cheese and wine pairings, with people rating the cheese as better in quality when paired with what they thought was an expensive wine. 

- This occurs because expectation powerfully influences experience. Expensive wine is expected to taste better, so the brain actually interprets the sensations differently. 

- True objectivity is considered impossible in psychology. Expectations, emotions, memories etc always influence an experience.

So wine experts can be led astray by manipulating their expectations about the wine. Their perception of taste is biased by what they believe about the wine, not just the true sensory experience.

 

- The gambler's fallacy is the mistaken belief that past random events can influence future random events. For example, believing a coin flip is "due" to come up heads after a series of tails. 

- In gambling, people often believe they are on lucky or unlucky streaks, when in reality the odds remain the same. Strategies like changing seats or blowing on dice don't actually improve your chances.

- Our pattern recognition abilities often lead us to see meaning and connections where there are none. We have a tendency to think we can predict or control random outcomes.

- Studies have shown people will subconsciously try to influence random events, like tossing dice harder when a higher number is needed. Or believing negative thoughts can cause harm to others.

- In reality, truly random events like coin flips or die rolls are statistically independent. The odds don't change based on past outcomes. Our perceived control is just an illusion.

- Casinos exploit this illusion of control. The longer you play, the more the odds even out, but in the short term you can experience win and lose streaks that seem like more than chance.

 

- The fundamental attribution error is the misconception that other people's behavior reflects their personality and disposition, when in reality it is more influenced by the situation they are in. 

- An example is when a server brings the wrong order at a restaurant. Customers tend to blame the server and leave a bad tip, even if the mistake was the kitchen's fault, not the server's.

- The author experienced this first-hand as a waiter in college. Bad tips would come when orders were wrong, even if it wasn't his fault. He knew service had more to do with the situation than his own disposition. 

- Customers still blamed the server when things went wrong, even if they were nice and tried to have good conversations. The fundamental attribution error leads people to overlook situational factors and mistakenly attribute behavior to personality.

- The error causes people to punish others for things outside of their control. It fosters acrimony among service workers who know they will be blamed for mistakes not their fault.

- The point is that other people's behavior is more a result of the situation than their personality or disposition, but the fundamental attribution error leads us to see it the opposite way.

 

- We often commit the fundamental attribution error - when we don't know someone well, we tend to explain their behavior based on internal personality traits rather than external situational factors. 

- This happens frequently, like when we assume servers are slackers or public figures are extremely smart based on limited interactions. 

- We put on social masks and play different roles in different situations, but forget others do the same. 

- The media promotes the fundamental attribution error through selective coverage, like focusing on "going postal" at the post office even though workplace violence happens in many settings.

- Whenrampage killers snap, we label them as insane rather than looking at external factors like workplace stress that may have contributed. 

- We turn people into predictable characters rather than understanding nuances and situational factors. 

- Attribution theory in social psychology recognizes internal vs external forces shape behavior. 

- We take mental shortcuts and make assumptions about others' motivations and personalities based on limited information.

- Experiments show we explain others' behaviors differently depending on whether we think they chose their actions or were forced into them.

- The fundamental attribution error causes us to ignore situational factors and rushed to blame personality.

 

- In experiments, people tend to attribute someone's behavior and beliefs to their character and personality, not the situation they are in. This is called the "fundamental attribution error".

- In one example, people thought debaters truly believed what they were arguing, not that they were assigned a position. 

- In Philip Zimbardo's infamous Stanford Prison Experiment, normal college students randomly assigned to be "guards" or "prisoners" started acting cruel or defeated as if the situation was real. This showed the power of situational roles and pressures to make people act in disturbing ways.

- We commit the fundamental attribution error when we judge someone's behavior as caused by who they are, not their circumstances. For example, thinking someone is unfriendly because of their personality, not because they are stressed.

- The error leads to false assumptions about people. We should consider the situation's power before blaming the person. Though it doesn't absolve evil actions, it can help prevent them by making us aware of environmental influences.

 

- The author's wife had an exceptional high school psychology teacher named Jean Edwards who used innovative and engaging teaching methods. Her classes were insightful and eye-opening, subverting expectations and making it respectable to question everything. 

- Edwards asked thought-provoking questions and fostered deep discussions, like debating whether a man who wrapped himself in newspaper daily was crazy. She nursed conversations rather than shutting them down.

- Her tests required deep understanding rather than memorization. She lost time for individual conversations with students. She provided a role model of a smart, successful woman who dared students to think differently.

- The author credits Edwards for changing his life, tilting his worldview, and showing that kindred spirits existed. Her class inspired the blog that led to this book. 

- The author thanks Jean Edwards for her revelatory teaching, her willingness to lose time conversing with students, and her role as an inspirational example of an intelligent questioning woman. She made a profound impact.

 Here is a summary of the key points from the passages on introspection, the availability heuristic, the bystander effect, the Dunning-Kruger effect, apophenia, brand loyalty, the argument from authority, the just-world fallacy, the public goods game, the ultimatum game, cult indoctrination, groupthink, supernormal releasers, the affect heuristic, and Dunbar's number:

Introspection 
- Introspection and rumination can lead to more negative thoughts and emotions rather than mitigating them.
- Thinking too much about our own thoughts and preferences can actually reduce the quality of our decisions. 

Availability Heuristic
- We tend to judge the likelihood of events based on how easily they come to mind, rather than looking at actual statistics.
- Vivid or emotionally charged events are more available in our memory, leading us to overestimate their frequency.

Bystander Effect  
- People are less likely to help in an emergency when others are present, due to diffusion of responsibility.
- Certain factors like ambiguity can inhibit helping behaviors.

Dunning-Kruger Effect
- People tend to overestimate their skills and abilities relative to others when they are incompetent.
- Actual competence leads people to underestimate their relative abilities.

Apophenia
- We have a tendency to perceive meaningful patterns or connections in random data.

Brand Loyalty
- Familiar brands activate reward circuitry in the brain.

Argument from Authority 
- Relying solely on authority figures can lead us astray if they are misinformed.

Just-World Fallacy
- The belief that the world is fair can lead to blaming victims for their misfortunes. 

Public Goods Game  
- People tend to act in their own self-interest, even when cooperation would lead to better outcomes overall.

Ultimatum Game
- Fairness matters to us - we will punish unfairness even at a cost to ourselves.

Cult Indoctrination
- Isolation, control, and repetition help reinforce cult ideology. 

Groupthink
- Cohesive groups can make faulty decisions when they fail to consider outside viewpoints.

Supernormal Releasers
- Exaggerated stimuli can elicit stronger responses than normal versions. 

Affect Heuristic 
- Reliance on emotional impressions can override more reasoned thinking.

Dunbar's Number
- Our cognitive limits constrain the number of stable social relationships we can maintain.

 Here is a summary of the key points about several social psychology concepts:

Conformity - People often conform to group norms and expectations, as seen in classic studies like Asch's line judgment experiment. This shows the power of social influence. 

Social loafing - When people work in groups, they tend to exert less individual effort, like in the Ringelmann rope pulling study. 

Illusion of transparency - We tend to overestimate how much our internal states/thoughts are visible to others. 

Learned helplessness - When people feel unable to escape failure, they stop trying, like in Seligman's dog experiment. This shows the impact of uncontrollable outcomes.

Anchoring effect - Initial values anchor our judgments, like the wheel of fortune study. This demonstrates how arbitrary suggestion can influence estimates.

Attention - People often miss unexpected events when focused elsewhere, like in Simons' invisible gorilla video. This highlights limited attention capacity. 

Self-handicapping - People proactively create obstacles to manage performance anxiety, like practicing less before a test. This can be a self-protective strategy.

The key theme is that human thinking and behavior are influenced by social context, limited cognitive resources, and motivations like self-enhancement. These principles help explain the gap between rational thought and actual outcomes.

 Here is a summary of the key points from the referenced journal articles on impression management and self-fulfilling prophecies:

Impression Management

- Smith, Snyder, and Perkins (1983): The self-handicapping strategy allows people to externalize potential failure and internalize success. Individuals use claimed impediments (real or fabricated) as an excuse for possible poor performance, protecting self-esteem.

- Ferrari (1991): People use self-handicaps to create a favorable impression, strategically attributing failures to external causes rather than lack of ability or effort. This preserves self-esteem and public image.

Self-Fulfilling Prophecies 

- Crano and Mellon (1978): Teacher expectations influenced student academic performance. Students who were expected to show greater intellectual growth did so, likely due to changes in teacher behavior toward those students.

- Spencer, Steele, and Quinn (1999): Negative stereotypes (e.g. women have inferior math ability) can create psychological threat that impairs performance, confirming the stereotype. This “stereotype threat” effect was found in women taking math tests.

- Steele and Aronson (1995): Black students performed worse on verbal tests when primed with negative stereotypes about race and intelligence, versus controls. Stereotype threat undermines ability through additional mental burden.

In summary, people use impression management strategies like self-handicapping to influence how others see them. Self-fulfilling prophecies show how our expectations shape reality, including academic performance. Both serve to protect self-image.
