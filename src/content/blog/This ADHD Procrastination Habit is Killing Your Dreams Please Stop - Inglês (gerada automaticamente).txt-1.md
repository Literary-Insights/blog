- The video is discussing the phenomenon of "procrastin learning" which is when someone devours all the courses, podcasts, books, and videos on a topic but never actually does the thing they are learning about. 

- This is a form of procrastination that feels justified because you're still learning, but it doesn't move you closer to your goal. It can lead to feeling behind and like a failure. 

- Two common reasons for procrastin learning are 1) preferring the idea of something like running a marathon over the reality of training for it, and 2) fear of failure and perfectionism from negative feedback received as a child with ADHD. 

- Confidence doesn't come from procrastin learning, only from actually doing the thing through trial and error. You have to start doing it poorly or messing up to improve. 

- Ways to stop procrastin learning include being real with yourself about whether you actually want to do the thing, designing your process to minimize fear of rejection, and starting small by posting on social media daily for example. 

- The key is putting in repetitions or practice through action, not just preparation, to gain experience and confidence over time in a sustained way.

 

- If you feel you have gaps in your knowledge, talk to an expert in the field you want to pursue. Ask them what else you should learn before getting started.

- Start taking action even if you don't feel fully prepared. Notice that you survive each small step. Confidence will build with experience. 

- Set a boundary to apply what you've learned before taking more courses or classes. Retaining knowledge requires putting it into practice. 

- Taking more courses may not address underlying fears holding you back like fear of failure or not knowing what to do. Action is the only way to overcome those fears.

- Start with one small action today, then ask what you can do tomorrow. Build momentum through consistent small steps rather than waiting to feel completely ready.

The key advice is to start taking action right away instead of waiting until you feel fully prepared. Confidence comes from experience, not more courses or learning. Apply what you've learned in small steps to build skills and reduce fears of the unknown.
