1. Team launches and periodic relaunches are critical for remote teams, especially following transitions to remote work. They help teams realign and get on the same page when out of sync.

2. Pre-work and the initial team launch account for 90% of team success, while day-to-day collaboration only accounts for 10%. 

3. Team launches allow team members to understand and agree on how they can work together most effectively to achieve their goals.

4. Periodic relaunch sessions are needed to keep remote teams cohesive and adjust to changing conditions.

5. A team launch typically lasts 1 to 1.5 hours and involves all team members sharing their opinions and perspectives in a video call.

6. The 4 essential elements of teamwork covered in team launches are:

- Shared goals that are clear and understandable
- Shared understanding of team member roles and responsibilities  
- Shared norms for how work and communication will happen
- Shared commitment where all members buy into the team's aims

In summary, the key takeaway is that team launches and relaunches are crucial processes for aligning and optimizing remote teams. They provide a structured discussion focusing on goals, roles, norms, and commitment - the core ingredients for teamwork.

 Here is a summary of the key points regarding roles, functions, and constraints within teams:

Roles: During a team launch session, each member should articulate their individual roles and how they can contribute to the team goals. Clarifying individual roles helps set expectations and ensures everyone understands each other's contributions. 

Functions: Team members must identify the resources they have to meet the team's goals. This includes information, budgets, technology, and networks. During relaunch sessions, the team reassesses available resources as conditions change.

Constraints: Team members should candidly share their unique constraints and perspectives. This allows the team to adjust task loads, manage deadlines, and support each other accordingly. Relaunch sessions give team members a chance to discuss new responsibilities that have been added.

Norms: The team establishes norms for how they will interact and collaborate effectively, especially important for remote teams. These norms cover communication methods, meeting procedures, and handling informal interactions. Relaunch sessions allow the team to review and adjust norms as needed based on changes in roles, tasks, or resources.

Overall, clarifying roles, resources, constraints, and norms during a team launch or relaunch session helps ensure alignment, set proper expectations, and maximize productivity and cohesion. Open discussion and transparency are important parts of identifying and refining how the team will function together.

 

1. Launch sessions for remote teams are important to establish communication norms and guidelines. This helps improve inclusion, collaboration and cohesion.  

2. Effective communication norms cover interaction plans, psychological safety and reducing isolation. They are not strict rules but shared principles.

3. Communication norms should outline how team members stay connected and informed about tasks and progress. This reduces confusion and delays.

4. Norms should foster an environment where conflicts and mistakes can be safely discussed. This helps the team learn and improve.

5. Norms should directly address how to reduce feelings of isolation that remote work can cause. This includes plans for face-to-face interactions and reachable team members.

6. Leaders need to reinforce their commitment to the team during launch sessions. This shows dedication to team members and creates a culture of appreciation.

In summary, launch sessions and establishing communication norms are vital for building effective remote teams. The norms guide how team members interact, discuss issues and stay connected despite physical distance. Leaders play an important role in endorsing these norms and demonstrating their commitment to all team members.

 Here is a summary of the provided text:

The text discusses the challenges of building trust in remote work environments where colleagues seldom meet in person. It contrasts this with default trust that easily develops among colleagues who work in the same office building through informal interactions.

Trust is fragile and difficult to repair once broken. While trust may seem binary, it is actually nuanced and complex. There are different levels of trust that can be useful in different situations.

The text focuses on two types of trust relevant for remote teams: passable trust and swift trust. 

Passable trust is the minimum level of trust required to work and communicate with others. It is based on observable behavior. Tara gained passable trust in Marisol from perusing her interactions on their company's social media platform.

Swift trust characterizes the high level of trust that must be swiftly established in temporary teams formed for a specific project. Members decide to trust one another until proven otherwise.

In summary, the text highlights the challenges of building trust remotely and discusses two types of trust - passable trust and swift trust - that can help enable remote teamwork. It argues that establishing different levels of trust based on the situation is important for managing trust in remote teams.

 Here is a summary of the provided text:

The text discusses two types of trust important for remote work: cognitive trust and emotional trust.

Cognitive trust is based on a colleague's competency and reliability. It develops over time through interactions and experiences. Cognitive passable trust is sufficient for simple information sharing. Cognitive swift trust develops quickly based on colleagues' competence and communication, enabling teams to work together effectively.

Emotional trust is based on feelings and caring. It develops through shared values and mindsets. Emotional trust takes longer to develop but can complement cognitive trust. 

The "trusting curve" shows how trust develops over time. Cognitive trust typically develops quickly but at a shallow level, while emotional trust develops more slowly but can reach a deeper level. 

Both cognitive and emotional trust are important for remote teams to function well. Managers need to understand what type of trust exists and how to cultivate the right trust for their teams.

The text uses examples to illustrate cognitive swift trust, where team members quickly develop enough trust based on competence to collaborate effectively and complete tasks, despite not knowing each other well initially.

In summary, the key points are: different types of trust important for remote work, how trust develops over time as visualized by the trusting curve, and the need for both cognitive and emotional trust for optimal team performance.

 

1. Virtual teams must collaborate quickly and build trust immediately, often called "swift trust." This can be challenging for people who value in-person relationship building.

2. Teams develop swift trust when members connect via functional ties for common goals. Swift trust starts high at the beginning and is "backfilled" as members work together over time.

3. Trust in virtual teams requires clear goals, transparency, communication, task clarity, reliability, and processes. 

4. Developing "direct knowledge" of team members' characteristics and behaviors helps build trust by providing insight and context. This can come from spending time together in-person or asking personal questions virtually.

5. "Reflected knowledge" - seeing your own behaviors through others' perspectives - enhances empathy and trust. It helps correct misperceptions and reveals differing norms.

6. Self-disclosure - sharing about yourself truthfully and intentionally - fosters trust through closeness, likability, and understanding of teammates' contexts. The more you learn about others, the closer you feel.

In summary, swift trust based on clear goals and functional ties must be supplemented with direct and reflected knowledge, self-disclosure, and context to develop emotional trust required for high-performing virtual teams.

 Here is a summary of the provided text:

Many people working remotely worry about productivity. They question how to measure productivity, track work, and ensure people are staying focused and not distracted. Managers worry about remote teams meeting goals and objectives without being able to see them in action.

While remote work does pose challenges, most managers have limited control over employee productivity even when employees are in the office. Deadlines are missed, problems arise, and customers are unhappy regardless of employees' location. 

In remote work, there are some things teams and managers can do to boost productivity:

• Set clear expectations and goals. Communicate what needs to be accomplished and by when.

• Track progress and provide feedback regularly. Check in to see if teammates need help staying on track.

• Foster accountability through check-ins, status reports, and project management tools. 

• Establish work rhythms and routines to build focus and discipline.

• Encourage people to set boundaries between work and personal life to avoid burnout.

• Promote a positive culture where people feel supported and engaged in their work, even from afar. This helps motivation and satisfaction.

In the end, most people can be just as productive - if not more so - when working remotely, if given the right environment, tools, oversight and support. Productivity depends much more on individuals and teams than on physical location.

 Here is a summary of the key points in the provided text:

1. Many companies are installing surveillance and tracking technologies for remote employees in an attempt to ensure productivity. However, these measures tend to backfire and demoralize employees.

2. According to researcher J. Richard Hackman, there are three criteria for assessing team productivity: delivering results, facilitating individual growth, and building team cohesion. 

3. Delivering results means achieving expected goals. This is an important measure of productivity.

4. Facilitating individual growth means team members learn and feel cared for, enhancing job satisfaction and productivity. 

5. Building team cohesion means the team operates as a unit, which boosts productivity.

6. Surveillance and tracking tools fail on these measures because they signal a lack of trust between employers and employees, eroding teamwork and satisfaction.

7. The real conditions that make remote workers productive involve focusing on individual growth, team cohesion, and autonomy rather than excessive monitoring.

Does this look like a fair summary of the key points from the provided text? Let me know if you would like me to expand or modify the summary in any way.

 Here is a summary of the provided text:

The text discusses the productivity benefits of remote work. It presents evidence from various studies showing that remote workers tend to be more productive compared to in-office workers.

Several examples of companies implementing remote work programs are discussed:

- Cisco experienced a rise in productivity and $195 million in savings after launching a remote work program. 

- Sun Microsystems saw 15% reduction in real estate holdings and savings of $500 million when a third of employees opted for remote work. Remote workers at Sun doubled to about 60% within 10 years.

Studies show that remote workers:

- Have 30% higher productivity due to saving time from commuting.

- Experienced 20-30% higher productivity and $2,000 cost savings per remote worker at China's Ctrip travel agency. Performance doubled to 22% for those who opted for remote work.

- Examiners working remotely at the US Patent and Trademark Office were found to be more productive compared to in-office workers.

In summary, the key takeaway is that remote work, when properly implemented, tends to increase employee productivity and save companies money through reduced real estate costs. The convenience and flexibility of remote work is seen as a major contributor to higher performance and satisfaction.

 

1. Remote workers need autonomy to be successful. They need flexibility in when and where they work. Having control and self-governance boosts their self-confidence, investment in work, and efficiency.

2. Studies show that remote workers who experience greater autonomy report higher job satisfaction, better performance, and lower turnover intentions.

3. Work conditions at home have to be conducive to productivity. Workers need adequate space, technology, and privacy. Large households or interruptions from others can interfere.

4. Home conditions can either complement remote work or cause conflict and unease, depending on the individual's situation. Flexibility and work-life balance can benefit some but blur boundaries for others.

5. Remote teams face an inherent challenge of distance and disconnect. However,  productive relationships do not depend entirely on physical proximity but also depend on things like effective communication and trust.

In summary, for remote workers to thrive, they need autonomy, choice, and work conditions that support their productivity and allow them to maintain boundaries between work and home life. Remote teams also face challenges due to lack of in-person interaction but can still foster effective working relationships.

 Here is a summary of the key points regarding how to use digital tools in remote work:

• Select the right tools to facilitate communication and collaboration based on your culture and goals. Atos banned email and replaced it with social networks, messaging, and collaborative tools. The tools should match your preferred mode of working.

• Consider synchronous vs asynchronous communication. Real-time communication like video calls and messaging allow for interaction "in the moment" while tools like email are asynchronous. Each has pros and cons for remote work.

• Use visual cues when possible. Seeing others via video can increase connection and understanding of nonverbal cues that get lost in text communication.

• Match the medium to the message. Some tasks may be better suited to chat, video calls, or shared documents. Consider the level of formality, urgency, and nuance needed. 

• Permanence matters. Email and messages in collaboration tools remain, so use these for more formal communication that may need to be referenced later.

• Signal importance. Highlighting text, using symbols like exclamation points, or calling someone directly can convey a message is time-sensitive.

• Follow up as needed. If a message via one medium does not elicit a response, try another channel to ensure the communication was received.

In summary, selecting the right digital tools and using them effectively can maximize collaboration and connectivity within remote teams. Consider the communication needs, permanence required, and options for real-time interaction when choosing how to utilize technology for your remote work.

 Here is a summary of the key points regarding effective communication in remote work:

•To avoid tech exhaustion, it is important to create breaks between video calls and not have back-to-back meetings. Transition time between meetings is crucial.

•The right communication tool depends on the situation. Email can be effective for as a reminder, but video calls are better for real-time collaboration. 

•The "mutual knowledge problem" refers to a lack of shared context and assumptions among remote workers, which can cause miscommunication and reduce effectiveness.

•"Social presence" refers to the degree to which a communication medium conveys social cues like expressions and voices. Face-to-face has the highest social presence.

• Intimacy and immediacy are aspects of social presence. Intimacy involves closeness and immediacy is the psychological distance felt.

• Different tools promote different goals. Some favor asynchronous work while others enable real-time collaboration. Choosing the right tools intentionally can improve effectiveness.

• Cultural differences can impact communication and tool usage, so being aware of those differences is important for remote teams.

In summary, avoiding tech exhaustion, overcoming the lack of shared context, using the appropriate communication tools for the situation, and being aware of cultural differences are all important for effective communication in remote work. Face-to-face interaction remains the "gold standard" but various digital tools try to emulate or complement it in different ways.

 Here is a summary of the provided text:

The text discusses the concepts of social presence, immediacy, and richness of media in the context of remote work communication.

Social presence refers to the sense of personalness, warmth, and connection that one person feels toward another during communication. It is influenced by factors like verbal and nonverbal cues, physical or emotional distance, dress, and facial expressions. The communication medium impacts how much social presence can be conveyed. 

Immediacy refers to how much closeness, openness and  positivity the communication conveys. It can change independently of social presence.

Efficiency and nonverbal communication also affect social presence. Face-to-face interactions have the highest social presence but may not always be the most efficient. Nonverbal cues are important for reducing ambiguity.

The text then discusses the concepts of lean and rich media. Lean media convey less information while rich media convey more social cues and context.

Different work activities are suited for different types of media based on whether they involve conveyance of new information or convergence to come to an agreement. 

The text lists characteristics of different media like delivery speed, number of recipients, expressiveness, ability to fine-tune messages, and message permanence. 

The text argues that rich media is not always the best choice. Team relationships, communication goals and tasks influence the best media choice. Nonroutine tasks benefit from awareness of who is doing what while tasks involving multiple languages/ time zones benefit from presence awareness enabled by video calls.

In summary, social presence, media richness and appropriate media choice depend on the communication context and goals.

 

• People rarely use just one medium for communication; they tend to use a mix of media to communicate with the same people. Savvy communicators strategically combine different digital tools.

• Redundant communication, using multiple media to say the same thing, can be essential for virtual teams to ensure messages are received. 

• Project managers employed two types of redundant communication:

- Those with formal authority reacted when their initial messages failed to produce change. They followed up with more synchronous communication to make sure the team understood the urgency.

- Those without authority used proactive redundant communication, starting with synchronous mediums like meetings, then following up with asynchronous mediums like email to provide substance and reminders.

• For globally distributed teams with cultural diversity:

- Leaner media like email can minimize misinterpretations due to cultural differences while richer media allows for complex content exchanges.

- Cultural backgrounds impact preferred communication media. Video is often preferred by cultures that favor face-to-face interaction.

- Email can be better than phone calls for delivering bad news so recipients have time to process first.

- We cannot assume our beliefs about the best media applies across cultures. We should ask communication partners about their preferences.

 Here is a summary of the relevant points regarding optimal media for communicating in cross-cultural teams:

• The appropriate communication technology will depend on the cultural and language backgrounds of colleagues.  Different cultures have different preferences for synchronous versus asynchronous communication.

• Social tools can help bridge geographic and cultural gaps by allowing employees to form personal and professional connections. This can increase trust and collaboration.

• Cross-national teams should consider cultural and language differences to determine the optimal media. Preferences for real-time versus delayed communication vary by culture and shared language competence.  

• Leaders must set a good example and properly utilize social tools for them to be effective. They must publicly engage with employees' posts and comments.

• Context is key when deciding what communication media to use. The characteristics of different tools and how they impact relationships must be understood.

In summary, the key recommendations are to be aware of cultural preferences, utilize social tools strategically to build connections across borders, set a good example as leaders, and choose the right communication media based on the cultural and linguistic context of the team. Understanding and accounting for these factors will determine the appropriate technologies and tools for cross-cultural collaboration.

 Here is a summary of the key points in the provided text:

1. Agile teams originated as a way for software developers to quickly deliver new software products to market. The agile methodology focuses on adaptive, iterative development and values individuals, working products, customer collaboration, and responding to change.

2. Agile teams are small (5-9 people), cross-functional, self-organizing, and value autonomy and accountability. They communicate frequently and use experiments and rapid prototyping to incorporate customer feedback.

3. Collocation and face-to-face communication are seen as essential to agile team effectiveness. However, agile methodology has been successfully scaled to distributed teams and adopted by remote teams.

4. While agile originated in software development, the approaches can be applied to other contexts beyond technical teams. Examples are given of agile being adopted by a toy manufacturer, R&D team, radio show, and banks.

In summary, the key points focus on the origins, features, assumptions, and spread of agile methodology, highlighting how remote work was initially seen as incompatible but has been accommodated in practice. The text also notes agile has been applied beyond software development.

 Here is a summary of the provided text:

The text discusses how large companies are adopting agile methodologies to improve efficiency and customer satisfaction. National 3M and Unilever are examples of conglomerates that have transitioned to agile teams. 

Unilever, a multinational consumer goods company, reorganized into autonomous agile teams to improve its global and local operations. Agile teams helped Unilever balance the needs of its global scale while meeting local market demands. Technology, process changes, and people were the three vectors that enabled Unilever's digital transformation and shift to agile teams.

AppFolio, a software company, was founded on agile principles from the start. The company attributes its success to its agile team structure and values having small, focused teams to stay agile.

In summary, the key points are:

1) Large companies are adopting agile methods to improve efficiency, speed, and customer satisfaction. 

2) Unilever reorganized into agile teams to better manage its global scale while meeting local market needs. 

3) Technology, process changes, and people were the three vectors that enabled Unilever's shift to agile teams.

4) AppFolio was founded on agile principles and values small, focused teams to remain agile.

The adoption of agile methods by large, legacy companies shows that agile approaches can work at scale when adapted appropriately for the organization. Remote agile teams also allow companies to operate globally while meeting the needs of local markets.

 

• Red and his co-founder started AppFolio and structured the company around agile teams from the beginning. The agile structure allowed teams autonomy to select their own projects and find solutions collaboratively. 

• Agile teams were made up of product managers, designers, QA engineers and full-stack developers who could move between teams as needed.

• When COVID hit, AppFolio had to transition to fully remote work, which posed challenges for their collaborative agile work style. Video calls replaced in-person interaction and informal conversations.

• Hawkins found that remote work made individual focused work more productive, though collaboration suffered.

• Teams that had established good communication norms before transitioning to remote work were better prepared.

• Teams that were already used to having some remote members also transitioned more easily.

• Best practices for remote agile teams included: establishing clear communication norms, using video conferencing optimally, maintaining team cohesion and psychological safety, adapting agile ceremonies for remote work, and revisiting agile practices regularly.

Hope this summary captures the main points effectively! Let me know if you need me to clarify or expand anything.

 Here is a summary of the remote agile practices mentioned in the passage:

1. Prepare Alone, End in Sync: Team members work asynchronously on individual tasks, then come together at scheduled meetings to collaborate in real time. This helps replicate the short, efficient meeting times of collocated agile teams. 

2. Brainstorm in Shared Documents: Using tools like Google Docs allows team members to contribute and iterate ideas asynchronously, capturing them for future reference. This can make remote brainstorming more effective than in-person conversations.

3. Streamline the Huddle: Remote daily stand-ups require more structure, like giving each person a dedicated time to speak without interruption. Reducing the number of initial participants can also speed up early decision making.

4. Set Digital Norms: The team establishes guidelines for using different communication tools like email, messaging, and calls to suit formal vs informal needs. 

5. Solicit Anonymous Feedback: Leaders use interactive feedback tools to gather real-time input from remote team members, maintaining honest communication that is key to agile methods.

Hope this summary helps! Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions.

 

• Cultural differences are inherent in global teams and can cause misunderstandings, lower performance, and discord if not addressed properly.

• Teams must go beyond surface level "dos and don'ts" and do deeper work to develop understanding of how others see the world and how they perceive your behaviors.

• Tariq Khan was hired to lead a global team with 68 members from 27 countries speaking 18 languages. 

• The team's performance has declined significantly in recent years under the previous manager.

• In Khan's meeting with three senior executives from the team, each had their own explanations for the issues blaming external factors, bad branding, compensation structure, etc. They seemed more focused on assigning blame than finding solutions.

• The competing theories and lack of consensus from the executives indicate deeper issues related to cultural differences that Khan must work to address and overcome to improve team performance.

The main takeaways are that cultural differences pose serious challenges for global teams but can be mitigated through understanding perspectives, building trust, and finding common ground. Khan's situation illustrates the dysfunction that can arise without proper awareness and management of cultural diversity.

 

• Psychological distance refers to the level of emotional or cognitive connection among team members. High psychological distance indicates a lack of understanding and empathy, while low psychological distance corresponds to more empathic connections. Global teams tend to have high psychological distance due to lack of physical proximity.

• Reducing psychological distance by increasing interactions and frequent communication can help global teams develop shared understanding, respect, and trust. 

• Language issues can exacerbate psychological distance in global teams by hampering communication. While English is often used as a lingua franca, fluency levels vary, posing challenges for leaders to manage.

• To minimize language's divisiveness and restore its unifying power, global team leaders need to manage challenges like differing fluency levels, prioritize clear communication, and create opportunities for team members to connect beyond just work tasks.

In summary, the key to improving global team performance lies in reducing psychological distance through deliberate efforts to increase communication, interactions, and shared understanding - despite linguistic and cultural differences among team members. Language must be managed effectively to promote greater cohesion within the team.

 

• While adopting a common language like English can unite an organization, it only solves part of the problem. Challenges still remain.

• When subgroups within a meeting speak in languages others don't understand, it creates an "us vs them" mentality and reduces trust. 

• Native English speakers can dominate conversations, assuming more status and excluding non-native speakers. They may also misunderstand non-native speakers' silence.

• Khan, the GM of the sales and marketing group, required employees to use English as the business language. But he realized language policy alone was not enough.

• Khan's actions included firing an employee who was culturally insensitive, adding cultural sensitivity to performance evaluations, and promoting diversity as a competitive advantage.

• The changes helped reduce contentiousness and fragmentation on the team, build trust, and improve sales, profits and employee satisfaction.

• For global teams to work inclusively, fluent speakers must speak slower, check for understanding, and limit dominating conversations. Non-fluent speakers should make an effort to speak up more and ask for clarification.

• Leaders must encourage both fluent and non-fluent speakers to adapt their communication behaviors for more inclusive discussions. 

Does this look like a fair summary? Let me know if you'd like me to expand on any part in more detail.

 Here is the summary:

Rules of engagement when speaking in a team can make a difference by promoting balance and inclusion. Team members need to monitor their speaking time and actively engage less dominant speakers. 

Team leaders should:

- Slow down the pace and use familiar language
- Refrain from dominating the conversation 
- Ask less fluent speakers for input
- Actively draw contributions from all members
- Solicit participation from less fluent speakers

This requires mutual adaptation and learning from each other:

- Mutual learning involves absorbing and asking questions to understand others' perspectives
- Mutual teaching involves instructing and facilitating to help others understand your perspective 

These cycles help build empathy and decrease psychological distance between team members. Team members become comfortable explaining their culture to others and understanding differences.

To succeed, teams should:

- Members fluent in the team language should dial down the pace and check in with less fluent speakers
- Less fluent members should dial up their participation despite fears of speaking up  
- Avoid code switching if some members share a native language

Overall, rules of engagement and mutual adaptation can promote balance, inclusion and effective communication in teams across differences.

 Here is a summary of the key challenges leaders face in virtual teams and how to overcome them:

Location Challenge: When some team members work remotely full-time while others work from an office part of the time, it can create a divide. Overcome it by recognizing that different locations impact people's experience and actively working to cross boundaries between subgroups. 

Class Divide: Remote workers may feel lesser than in-office workers, leading to resentment. Leaders must demonstrate that location does not impact value or contribution.

Us vs. Them: Subgroups form around locations, leading to "us" and "them" attitudes. Leaders must promote shared experiences, transparency, and open communication across the subgroups.

Predictability: Virtual teams rely more on schedules and plans due to lack of in-person interactions. Leaders must establish clear norms, roles and expectations to provide predictability.  

Performance Feedback: Leaders lose visibility into employee performance working remotely. They must establish structured feedback processes and check for understanding.

Team Engagement: Leaders miss opportunities for informal interactions that build culture and motivation virtually. They must create formal ways to engage team members and connect them to the larger purpose.

In summary, leaders facing these challenges must proactively identify issues early, empower their teams, and create the conditions for success - especially when they are not physically present. Leadership then extends beyond the leader's direct actions to shaping the virtual team environment.

 Here's a summary of the key points:

1. Teams with unequal numbers of members in subgroups can cause issues like lower identification and awareness among minority subgroups. Solo workers can also feel excluded. 

2. Members of larger subgroups may resent those in smaller subgroups, assuming the larger group contributes more. Solo workers may fear being usurped.

3. Leaders must work to foster equity among subgroups and recognize individual strengths.

4. Faultlines are invisible divisions that can split a group into "us vs them" subgroups. They form along differences in role, expertise, personality, gender, age, race, etc.

5. When faultlines become strong and distant, they can cause conflicts, coordination issues, and less collaboration.

6. Strong faultline divisions around languages and nationalities were found to create "us vs them" dynamics in some software teams, triggered by power contests within the teams.

7. Team leaders were often unaware of the issues causing dysfunction from faultlines.

8. While faultlines can be harmful, under some conditions they had no negative effect on team performance and could even aid decision making.

In summary, team structures with imbalanced subgroups and strong faultlines can cause exclusion, resentment, and "us vs them" dynamics, but with awareness and effort from leaders, the potentially negative effects of these phenomena can be mitigated or even harnessed productively.

 

1. Leaders of dispersed teams must be aware of dynamics like "we love to hate such-and-such a group" that can become limiting and insular. 

2. An overarching strategy to repair fractures among team members is needed, like helping teams reappraise and be more positive and empathetic.

3. Leaders can counteract faultlines by stressing one group-level identity and superordinate goals that unite the team. 

4. Providing frequent, clear communication gives virtual team members a sense of predictability that shapes their work. 

5. Leaders must routinely provide performance feedback and weigh in on reviews/promotions of remote workers.

6. Engaging remote teams requires intentionally structuring informal interactions, emphasizing individual differences, and encouraging productive conflict.

7. Leaders should set aside time for virtual informal chat, lunches, and breaks to promote spontaneous interaction.

8. Leaders should ask for individual opinions and avoid labeling people by subgroups to emphasize differences in a positive way.

9. Forcing respectful conflict around ideas and processes strengthens teamwork and helps people realize their potential.

Does this look like a good summary of the main points? Let me know if you would like me to adjust or expand anything.

 Here is a summary of the key points in the provided text:

1. Today, all leadership is global. Events in one part of the world can quickly impact businesses and teams globally. Crises and disruptions are to be expected and require leaders to develop new capacities to respond. 

2. The world is characterized by VUCA - volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity. VUCA forces create conditions for global ripple effects and interconnectedness that make crises more common. Leaders must cultivate mindsets to navigate this world.

3. The "country-of-origin effect" matters for global companies. Cultural and political dynamics in a company's home country can impact their operations globally.

4. Cognitive diversity on teams is essential for addressing global challenges. Teams with diverse perspectives can better spot issues and develop innovative solutions.

5. Leaders like Galya Molinas must learn to successfully navigate crises caused by external events beyond their control, like political unrest or the COVID-19 pandemic. This requires new strategies and approaches.

6. The text highlights the need for leaders to remain aware of global issues and developments while also remaining attuned to local contexts and priorities. Global concerns and local issues must work together.

That covers the key points and major themes discussed in the provided excerpt. Let me know if you would like me to expand on or clarify any part of this summary.

 Here is a summary of the key points in the provided text:

1. Global leaders must develop panoramic awareness to effectively handle volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity (VUCA). This means scanning for global issues and consuming a variety of international media.

2. Galya Molinas consumes international media like BBC, The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Financial Times, The Economist and Al Jazeera to stay informed. 

3. The country-of-origin effect, where consumers stereotype products based on their country of origin, poses threats to companies through consumer boycotts. Global leaders must anticipate this.

4. Molinas faced anti-American sentiment in Turkey that led to declining Coca-Cola sales. She had to shift her awareness from her team's success to the broader issue threatening them.

5. The country-of-origin effect has led to consumer boycotts against Western companies in the Middle East due to anti-Western sentiment. Sainsbury's had to exit Egypt after $125 million in losses.

6. To develop panoramic awareness, leaders must scan a broad landscape of global issues but also zoom into local details using a "wide angle lens" and "portrait lens" respectively.

That covers the key points regarding developing panoramic awareness as a global leader based on the provided text. Let me know if you would like me to expand or modify the summary in any way.

 

• Country of origin effects refer to consumer tendencies to favor or boycott products from certain countries based on political events or perceived cultural or ideological affinities. 

• Companies can face boycotts even when they have no direct link to the triggering political event. Effective communication and messaging can help reshape negative perceptions.

• Global leaders need to understand that consumer boycotts are often influenced by international political events rather than corporate practices.

• Framing a crisis situation involves anticipating multiple scenarios to counter possible effects. This allows leaders to proactively prepare for short-term and long-term impacts.  

• Singapore framed the COVID-19 crisis well by building a coordinated task force based on lessons from past crises. Other cities that framed the risks properly were able to take precautions earlier.

• To reinvent her business in response to the crisis, Molinas needed to reframe the situation by diversifying her team. She realized her homogenous team lacked the necessary experience with emerging markets and diverse perspectives to adequately respond to the consumer boycotts.

In summary, global leaders must learn to frame crises by generating solutions with diverse minds in order to anticipate and respond effectively to trigger events driven by international politics.

 Here is a summary of the key solutions discussed in the passage:

1. Build a diverse leadership team with experts from emerging markets. Molinas realized she needed people from diverse backgrounds who had experience in emerging markets to understand the complex dynamics of those markets. She built a new leadership team with executives from Mexico, South Africa, Greece, Venezuela, and other countries with experience in over 20 emerging markets.

2. Create a team with complementary skills and experiences. The new leadership team members brought relevant experience from multiple emerging markets. While diverse, they shared core values that allowed them to work collaboratively. 

3. Invest in building team cohesion. Though diversity brings benefits, it also requires extra effort to build trust and effective communication. Team members had to adjust to different work styles and cultures.

4. Embrace productive disagreement and conflict. The diverse team eventually developed a dynamic of open debate and discussion that improved problem-solving and innovation.

5. Act decisively when change is needed. Molinas acted quickly to restructure her team once she realized it lacked the skills and experiences needed. She stressed the importance of acting immediately when change is recognized as necessary.

6. Implement an appropriate team structure. Molinas transitioned to a more centralized structure with general managers close to local markets so the team could act quickly based on insights from diverse perspectives.

In summary, building a diverse global team with relevant experience from multiple emerging markets,combined with efforts to create cohesion and effective processes, enabled Molinas to develop insights and solutions that addressed her business challenges. Acting decisively to restructure her team when needed was also a key step.

 Here's a summary of the action guide exercises:

1. The trusting curve can help your team determine the appropriate level of trust by:
- Clarifying the level of trust required at each stage of your remote team's work 
- Indicating when more or less trust is needed to progress towards your goals

2. Swift trust is a higher level of initial trust based on roles, categories and face value. It's ideal for temporary remote teams. Passable trust is a lower, functional level of trust that aims to just "get by". It's suitable for many ongoing remote teams.

3. Describe a personal experience that demonstrates emotional trust building among your remote colleagues:
 Ex. "We had a long video call to share stories about our families and hobbies. I felt more connected to my team after learning more about them on a personal level."

4. List 2-3 methods to build direct knowledge of remote colleagues:
 Ex. Regular 1:1 video calls, sharing peer feedback, getting involved in teammates' projects

5. If you're a leader, describe 1-2 ways you can model trustworthiness to remote teammates:
  Ex. "I share my decisions and reasoning transparently. I show vulnerability by admitting mistakes and seeking feedback."

Hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

 Here are the summarized responses for the prompts:

1. You need to develop emotional trust with remote teammates through words and actions. Focus on:

• Having frequent communication to build familiarity 
• Sharing personal details to show authenticity and build connections
• Using direct and honest language to build reliability and credibility

2. To gain direct knowledge of remote teammates, you can:

• Have video calls to observe facial expressions and nonverbal cues
• Listen actively to better understand them 
• Ask open-ended questions to learn about their perspectives

3. To gain reflected knowledge, you can:

• Provide honest feedback and actively seek feedback from teammates
• Share how they impact you to gain insight into how they see you

Productivity depends on results, growth and cohesion. Assess your outputs, growth opportunities, and team connectedness to identify gaps and take action to improve. Pick the right digital tools based on the need for synchronicity, richness and formality. Agile methods pair well with remote work by prioritizing accountability, transparency and adaptability. Build a shared team identity by focusing on common goals, common language, and interactions that highlight similarities. Remote leaders must intentionally minimize faultlines, maximize individuals and unite the team around common goals. Anticipating crises requires panoramic awareness, active anticipation and acting immediately - skills your remote team can develop and improve.

 Here is a summary of the provided text:

The key to successfully launching a remote team is establishing alignment on the team's goals, roles, processes, and priorities. A proper launch session ensures team members understand their interdependencies and how they will work together. Remote team members often belong to multiple teams, so clarity around their roles in each team is critical.   

Trust between remote colleagues can be challenging to build but is essential for collaboration. Swift trust based on shared goals and norms can develop initially but must transition to more emotional trust based on personal connection and concerns for each other's welfare. Self-disclosure and transparency can help build emotional trust. Understanding cultural differences can also help foster trust across distances.   

Ensuring remote team productivity requires more than just technology like surveillance software. Excessive monitoring can breed stress, disengagement, and turnover. Instead, companies should focus on the three criteria for effective teams: clear and challenging goals, autonomy in choosing how to achieve goals, and access to resources and support needed for success. Productivity-tracking tools should be used sparingly and transparently. Remote work flexibility, when done right, has been shown to boost employee engagement and performance.

In summary, remote team launches, trust building, and performance management based on empowerment rather than excessive monitoring are key factors for success in the long run. Technology only enables remote work; team and organizational culture ultimately determines whether remote teams can thrive.

 Here is a summary of the key points regarding remote work and digital tools:

• Flexible work arrangements like remote work can increase productivity by 4%-9%. However, feelings of isolation and exhaustion can negatively impact performance and job satisfaction. 

• The appropriate use of digital tools depends on the communication needs and team dynamics. More "lean" tools like email focus more on content while "rich" tools like video conferencing add social cues.

• For tasks like negotiation and decision making, synchronous, real-time communication via video conferencing can be beneficial. But asynchronous tools like messaging are useful for sharing information.

• Being mindful of cultural differences and norms is important for effective communication in remote teams using digital tools.

• Redundant communication across multiple tools can help build trust and team identity, though it can also introduce inefficiencies.

• Agile remote teams require autonomy, accountability and strong communication. Both synchronous and asynchronous tools can enable transparency, collaboration and quick iteration.

• Organizations that have successfully implemented agile approaches remotely cite improvements in customer satisfaction, project outcomes and employee engagement.

In summary, digital tools are essential enablers for remote work, but their effective use depends on task requirements, team dynamics and communication needs. With the right tools, processes and culture, remote teams can achieve agility, productivity and positive outcomes.
