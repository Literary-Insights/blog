- The author's husband Dave died suddenly while on vacation in Mexico. She went through an intense grieving process afterward.

- The grief felt like a deep void that disrupted her ability to function. Everyday events were painful reminders of her loss. She struggled to appear normal in public and worried constantly, especially about her young children.

- A psychologist friend, Adam Grant, helped her realize that while grief was unavoidable, she could take action to become more resilient. Resilience is the ability to adapt to hardship, not just endure pain. She could choose how to respond.

- The three P's - personalization, pervasiveness, and permanence - often stunt recovery from adversity. The author had to overcome self-blame and the belief Dave's death would ruin her life forever. Focusing on the good parts of life and eliminating negative language helped.  

- Leaning into the pain, accepting suffering, and maintaining connections gave her solace. Gratitude for blessings like health and financial security were helpful. But the loss of Dave and resulting anxiety were profoundly difficult.

- Four months later, a false cancer diagnosis sparked panic over losing her too and leaving her kids alone. The relief when it was disproven gave profound gratitude for her health. 

- The author wished she understood cognitive distortions and the three P's sooner. Pervasiveness impacted her after a divorce, as she felt defined by failure. But with time, she saw failures as fleeting. This knowledge could have saved much anguish.

- Many friends avoided discussing Dave, making her isolation worse. But "openers" who asked questions and listened without judgment helped her feel less alone. Speaking openly about grief and loss is important. 

- The author's story shows how perspective and mindset help overcome despair. Accepting suffering, focusing on gratitude, and challenging negative thoughts turn hardship into hope. But grief remains, and she continues to miss Dave. 

That covers the key highlights and main takeaways from the author's journey and quest to build resilience in the face of deep loss and grief. Please let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on any part of the summary.

 

- The author unexpectedly lost her husband Dave, leaving her to raise two small children. She felt lonely and isolated in her grief. Many friends and colleagues didn't know what to say and avoided talking about Dave's death. 

- Only a few people, like her boss Mark and a woman she met at her daughter's soccer game, seemed to understand her pain. They were willing to listen and talk openly about her loss.

- The author posted about her experience on Facebook to express how casual greetings like "How are you?" were hurtful. The post received a huge response, with many sharing their own losses and offering support. She realized she wasn't alone.

- The author learned that being open about her feelings encouraged others to open up too. Asking for support and telling people what she needed helped her connect to friends and colleagues. 

- The author concludes that avoiding difficult topics can worsen suffering. Speaking openly helps people feel understood and supported. Offering to listen without judgment is the greatest gift.  

- Self-compassion involves showing yourself the same kindness you show others. It helped the author recover after losing her husband. Journaling and acknowledging small wins each day built her confidence from the inside out.

- The story of Catherine Hoke shows how self-compassion can transform lives. After a failure, she found meaning by helping others. Self-compassion protects us from harsh self-judgment and gives us the courage to take risks.

- Overall, the author learned that true confidence comes from self-compassion, not external measures of success or the approval of others. Speaking up, asking for support, and being willing to support others in turn create meaningful connections that make suffering feel less isolating. Communication and compassion are vital.

 Here is a summary in 50 words:

The author lost her husband. At first, she avoided happiness due to guilt. Friends helped her see that honoring him meant living fully. She pushed past pain to find joy for her kids. An Army Ranger finished grueling training by thinking of being a superhero for her kids. The author followed her lead, playing a game her husband loved.

 

- Finding moments of joy and happiness, even in times of adversity, builds resilience. The author resolved to notice and record three moments of joy each day after her husband died. This helped combat feelings of despair.

- Happiness requires effort and intentional practice. We must work to focus on positive moments since we naturally focus more on negatives. Savoring and sharing good experiences can boost happiness. 

- As we age, happiness is more about peace than excitement. New routines and activities help after loss. The author started new hobbies and spent time with her kids.

- Honest communication and a loving environment build children’s resilience. The author’s friend advised her on how to tell her kids their dad died. Though difficult, their openness helped the family cope.

- Four beliefs foster resilience in children: some control over life, learning from failure is possible, they matter, and they have real strengths. Educators help children discover strengths. 

- Growth mindset supports resilience. Praising effort, not inherent ability, helps. Interventions improved at-risk students’ outcomes. Parents and teachers can be inconsistent in promoting growth mindset.

- Madeline Levine says viewing struggle as normal builds resilience. Carol Dweck recommends praising effort over ability. Knowing you matter provides well-being. Support programs help at-risk youth.

- Music helped Kayvon Asemani, whose mother was killed by his father, find and develop his strengths. With support, he overcame difficulties and became high school valedictorian.

- Beliefs become self-fulfilling. Believing in learning from failure makes you open to failure. Believing you matter makes you help others more. Believing in strengths helps you see opportunities to use them.

- The author created “family rules” to cope, like allowing sadness, forgiving, sleep, and asking for help. Parenting alone was hard but she relied on others’ advice. She worried how much grief to show her kids. She now shares her own tears and stories. 

- Sharing stories of loss and family history builds resilience. Though sad, it can comfort. The author shares memories of her late husband with her kids.

- The author told a friend she was flirting with someone new. At first, he reacted badly, saying he wasn't ready for this. But his aunt said this reaction was unsupportive. The friend apologized and pledged his support. 

- The author went on her first date in over a decade with a kind man named Craig. They had an enjoyable time talking over dinner. Though dating felt strange, she was proud of herself for putting herself out there. However, she didn't feel ready for a second date yet. 

- A year after losing her husband, the author felt she had turned a corner in her grief. She felt more open to living fully again. Though the pain of loss would always remain, she had found the strength and courage within herself to build a new life. She knew her husband would want her to be happy. 

- The key themes are overcoming loss and guilt to start living fully again, facing double standards and judgment as a widow dating, gaining the courage to date after losing a spouse, rebuilding life after loss, and honoring a spouse's memory by finding happiness.

Guilt teaches; shame undermines. Writing about struggles compassionately heals. All suffer; all deserve compassion.

• Self-confidence and resilience are important for well-being and success. Journaling and reflecting on small wins can help build confidence, though may need to be tailored to individual needs.

• Addressing basic needs like financial security, healthcare, and childcare is critical for vulnerable groups. Social support programs have been found helpful for the unemployed, single parents, and others facing significant life challenges.

• Meaning and purpose are key to resilience and growth following loss or trauma. Some techniques that help include reflecting on benefits and lessons, engaging in meaningful social interactions, expressing gratitude, focusing on joyful moments. Many find new purpose through volunteer work or advocacy.

• A "growth mindset"—the belief that abilities can be developed through effort—helps build resilience. Programs teaching children that struggle and failure are normal and helping them feel they matter to others have been found effective. Empathy is also key.

• The Girls First program in India aims to empower disadvantaged girls through education, promoting a growth mindset, fostering purpose and connection, addressing trauma, sharing stories of resilience, and fighting stigma. The program helps girls build resilience through social support and discovering their own strength.

• Failing and learning from mistakes builds resilience at work. Recommendations for creating a "culture of learning" from failure include: providing safe spaces for open discussion of failures; leaders modeling openness to failure; focusing on learning over blame; giving coaching and feedback; and building psychological safety so people feel comfortable admitting mistakes.

In summary, research shows that resilience—the ability to overcome hardship—can be developed and enhanced through supportive relationships, reflection, finding meaning and purpose, promoting a growth mindset, and normalizing struggle and failure. At both individual and community levels, multidimensional approaches focused on basic needs, education, fostering social connections, and learning from mistakes have the best chance of success. While resilience is a lifelong project, its foundations are built from an early age.

 

The article discusses the importance of a “growth mindset” in overcoming failures and setbacks. With a growth mindset, people view failures as learning opportunities rather than permanent deficiencies. By practicing persistence, people can improve and grow from failures. But they must believe that growth and change are possible.

To build a culture where people feel comfortable failing and learning, effort and persistence are required. Fostering openness to failure and creating opportunities to learn from difficulties can drive resilience, innovation, and long-term success. The most adaptable and enduring organizations tend to see failure as a chance for growth rather than something to hide or punish.

In summary, the key points are:

1) A "growth mindset" views failures as learning opportunities, not permanent flaws. 

2) With practice and persistence, people can improve and grow from failures. But they must believe growth is possible.

3) Creating a culture where failure is acceptable requires work but drives success. 

4) The most enduring organizations treat failure as a means of growth, not something to conceal.

5) Failing and learning from mistakes fuels resilience, innovation, and long-term success.
