 Here is a summary of the book's table of contents:

The book covers how to launch products and grow businesses. It starts with the author's personal story going from a stay-at-home dad to earning six figures in a week. It then explains the product launch formula and the importance of building an email list. The book discusses sales letter writing, using mental triggers, prelaunch strategies, and different launch models like the seed launch for starting from scratch and joint venture launches. It provides a blueprint for launching a business you love, delivering value, and making an impact. The book shares real-world examples, case studies, and step-by-step instructions on how to create and execute successful launches.

 

- Jeff Walker shares his proven formula for launching products and building businesses rapidly. The formula is based on real-world results from his own launches and hundreds of student launches. 

- Everything in the book comes from experience, testing, and what actually works - no theories. Real examples and case studies are provided, not hypotheticals.

- The goal is to help readers launch like big brands and eliminate competition, no matter their budget. Readers will learn how to get customers eagerly awaiting their launch.

- Jeff loves bragging about student successes, as he believes entrepreneurs are the future and he is passionate about helping them. 

- The book teaches readers how to build businesses fast, create powerful positioning, generate buzz, and make sales. Supplemental trainings, videos, and resources are available on the book's website.

- Jeff believes we live in an amazing time to be an entrepreneur, and he wants to empower readers to live life on their own terms. The formula shared can help create businesses people love and design the life they want.

 

- The author launched a successful product and business from humble beginnings - starting in his basement with a beat-up computer and dial-up internet. 

- His first product was a simple email newsletter giving stock market predictions. Despite no experience, his launch resulted in over $34,000 in sales in the first week.

- This allowed his wife to quit her job and come home, providing desperately needed income for their family. 

- The author explains this is not a get-rich-quick scheme, but there are proven methods for creating businesses and generating profits quickly with low overhead costs. 

- He argues the internet has made it easier than ever to start and grow a business. His own students have gone on to generate hundreds of millions in sales with these methods.

- The book will reveal the formula behind the success and introduce the world of ordinary people building extraordinary businesses from their homes. 

- The goal is to start profitable businesses that also create value in the world.

 

- Jeff Walker started his first online business in 1996 and has been profitable every year since, through various economic downturns and Google updates. He's sold tens of millions of dollars of products online across different markets. 

- He is considered a top internet marketing expert, though he didn't have any prior sales or marketing experience before starting his online business. 

- The "rules" of business and marketing have changed with the rise of the internet and social media. This has created challenges but also new opportunities.

- After developing a successful "product launch formula," Walker had a $1.1 million launch in 24 hours for an online course. This demonstrated the power of his formula.

- Since then, he has taught thousands of students his product launch methods through his Product Launch Formula (PLF) training. PLF owners have gone on to generate over $500 million in sales across a huge variety of niches and markets.

- The key points are that internet marketing has changed the rules of business, Walker developed a successful product launch formula, he taught it to others through PLF, and it has generated massive success across many different markets.

 

- John Gallagher was struggling to support his family and relied on food stamps, but he had an entrepreneurial dream of selling an educational board game he created. 

- He invested nearly $20,000 to produce 1,500 games, filling his home with the inventory. 

- At his initial product launch party, he only sold 12 games, leaving him surrounded by failure and unsold inventory.

- On the brink of defeat, John's wife urged him to search online for help launching a product, leading him to Jeff Walker's Product Launch Formula (PLF). 

- Despite already being in debt, John borrowed more money to invest in PLF training. 

- Using the PLF method, John quickly planned and executed a new product launch. 

- The results were hugely successful - in just his first 10 days John sold well over 1,000 games, generating over $30,000 in sales. 

- PLF snatched victory from the jaws of defeat, allowing John to sell his inventory, pay off his debts, and build a thriving business that now earns six figures annually.

 

- Jeff Walker started his online business in 1996 during the early days of the internet when there was a huge opportunity for "little guys" to thrive. 

- He created a system called the Product Launch Formula (PLF) to generate buzz and demand for a product before it is released. Using PLF, he made over $100k in a week and taught others who went on to make over $1 million in 24 hours. 

- PLF has now been used by Walker's students and clients to generate over $500 million in product launches across many markets. It works for all types of businesses and products.

- PLF gets your target audience engaged and excited about your product so they want to buy it as soon as it's released. It's a proven system that keeps working. 

- The internet has sped up communication, allowed anyone to start a business, and given businesses global reach. This has created huge opportunities for entrepreneurs.

- Walker calls this new world of online business the "secret world" where ordinary people build extraordinary businesses from scratch with little overhead. It has transformed lives.

- He promises to explain exactly how his formula works so anyone can leverage it to quickly build their own business and results.

 

- Communication is faster, cheaper, and more interactive than ever before. Within minutes, you can broadcast a message to your audience and get instant feedback. This has changed marketing dramatically.

- You want to build anticipation and excitement for your product launch, like how Hollywood hypes up movies or Apple launches new products. This creates momentum versus just hoping your product does well. 

- Engage your audience in a conversation instead of just shouting about your product's features. Ask them questions to get a dialogue going.

- Use sequences of communication that build on each other rather than relying on a single message. For example, the pre-prelaunch, prelaunch, launch, and post-launch sequences. 

- Tell a compelling story that triggers emotions like authority, social proof, community, anticipation, and reciprocity. Gradually build up over the prelaunch sequence.

- The key is to cut through the communication fog by using sequences, stories, and triggers that engage your audience, rather than just blasting one-off sales messages. This helps create a highly successful product launch.

 Here are a few key points from the chapter:

- Having an email list is like having a license to print money - it gives you the ability to generate income on demand whenever you need it. 

- The author didn't have a college savings plan for his kids because he knew he could tap into his email list to make money for tuition when the time came.

- When the author wanted to move and needed $70,000 for a down payment on a new house, his first thought was what offer he could make to his email list to quickly raise the money rather than borrowing it. 

- The author made a launch to his list for a new info product and generated over $100,000 in about 3 weeks. This demonstrates the power of having an engaged email list.

- You need to build your list by providing value and content upfront without asking for money right away. Give more value than you ask for in return.

- An email list is one of the most valuable assets you can have in a business. Treat your list with respect by providing them value, and they will reward you by purchasing your offers.

- Start building your list now, even if you don't have a product yet. Provide value by sending great content on your topic and collecting emails in exchange.

Does this help summarize the key points about the power and value of building an email list? Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!

 

- Building an email list is a core strategy for any online business. Your list of subscribers who opt-in to receive your emails is extremely valuable. 

- When you have a list, you have the power to "push send and make money" by sending offers, promotions, etc to your list. A responsive list where people actually open and click on your emails is most valuable.

- List building has been Jeff's #1 strategy from the start. He focused on building relationships with list subscribers by providing value and sharing personal details, which makes subscribers more likely to open and engage with his emails.

- Email is still far more powerful than social media for list building. Email lands directly in someone's personal inbox which you have to treat with care and respect. 

- Spam (unsolicited emails) should never be sent. Only send emails to people who have opted in and requested to receive them. 

- The Product Launch Formula process is excellent for building relationships and responsiveness with your email list by providing value.

 

- Email lists are much more powerful than social media lists for business. An email list of 1,000 can outperform a Facebook following of 20,000. 

- There are two main risks with building lists on social media platforms: the platform could change their rules on how you use the list, and the platform itself could decline in popularity. 

- It's important to distinguish between a "prospect" list (people who haven't bought yet) and a "buyer" list (people who have bought). A list of buyers is far more valuable, worth 10-15x a prospect list.

- To build your list, first identify your target audience or "avatar". Create a squeeze page with an ethical bribe or opt-in offer to get visitors to join your email list. Split test different versions of the squeeze page to optimize conversion rates. 

- A squeeze page forces visitors to choose to either opt-in or leave. Most visitors will leave, so you need traffic to build your list. Focus on getting targeted traffic.

- Be patient and persistent with list building. It takes time but pays off exponentially. An email list is the most valuable asset you can build in your business.

 

- Every visitor will eventually leave your website, so capturing their email address is crucial to drive them back. 

- A squeeze page forces visitors to either opt-in to your email list or leave your site. This converts more visitors into subscribers compared to just having a subscribe box.

- The effectiveness of a squeeze page depends on having a strong "ethical bribe" or opt-in offer that aligns with your target audience's desires.

- Driving traffic to your squeeze page can be done through search engine optimization, paid ads, social media, content creation, affiliates/joint ventures, etc. 

- List building is essential for any online business. Start with a small list and build momentum over time. A product launch is a great way to rapidly grow your list.

- The key is to just get started with list building, even if starting from zero subscribers. Focus on providing value to subscribers and the list will grow. A small but engaged list can generate substantial revenue.

 Here is a summary of the key points from the chapter:

- In 1996, the author stumbled onto a new sales strategy called the Sideways Sales LetterTM while starting his first online business. This strategy has gone on to generate millions in sales. 

- Traditional sales letters are long, text-heavy pitches used in direct marketing for decades. They migrated online in the late 90s and were very effective. 

- However, as people became more connected due to the internet, they grew more skeptical of overt sales pitches. The traditional sales letter approach started to become less effective.

- The Sideways Sales LetterTM flips the traditional sales letter on its side, spreading the sales message over multiple pieces of "Prelaunch Content" delivered over several days leading up to the sale. 

- This turns the sales process into an ongoing conversation and builds anticipation and excitement. It provides real value rather than just a sales pitch.

- The author shares an example of a professional juggler who used this strategy to build a business teaching others to juggle after an injury ended his performing career. This allowed him to get off the "work train" and onto the "leverage train" by leveraging his knowledge.

In summary, the Sideways Sales LetterTM sequence is an extremely effective modern update to the traditional long sales letter approach. It works with, rather than against, modern consumers' expectations.

 

- Barry was a professional juggler who made a good living performing at shows and on TV. However, he was still trading his time for money - if he didn't perform, he didn't get paid. 

- He decided to start teaching other entertainers how to market themselves and land high-paying corporate gigs, creating an online training program and membership site. 

- He then created a high-end coaching offer called the "Showbiz Blueprint" - a 10-week small group coaching program for $2,000. This was suited to a launch model as it was a big decision/investment for customers.

- In his prelaunch videos, he established rapport by sharing his own story and pains of trying to make it as an entertainer. He inspired viewers by showing success was possible.

- He gave away really valuable marketing training, establishing his authority on the topic. He wasn't worried about giving away too much free value as he was selling a premium offer. 

- The prelaunch videos helped build a relationship and trust with his audience before making his offer. There was no sales pitch in the videos, just great content.

- Even though most viewers wouldn't buy, the goal was to identify and build relationships with serious prospects who would invest in his high-end coaching.

 You raise an important point. While mental triggers can be used unethically, they can also be powerful tools for positive influence when applied appropriately. As with any influential technique, intention and ethics matter greatly. I agree we should use these principles judiciously to provide value, not manipulate. Building authority through expertise and helping people is much preferred to superficial displays of power. With care, mental triggers can help communicate worthy ideas. But the responsibility ultimately lies with each person. I appreciate you highlighting this nuance.

 Here are the key points about using mental triggers in marketing:

1. Authority - Establishing yourself as an authority figure through credentials and achievements can make people more receptive to your message. Jeffrey cites sharing his punishment stories and billionaire client wins to establish authority.

2. Reciprocity - People feel obligated to give back when you give them something first. The free value in a prelaunch sequence triggers this, making people want to reciprocate by purchasing. 

3. Trust - Building trust over time through repeated positive interactions makes people more likely to buy from you. The prelaunch sequence allows you to build trust through consistent content.

4. Anticipation - Creating anticipation and scarcity around a launch date grabs attention. People get excited for the launch event. 

5. Likeability - Being gracious, kind, and generous makes you more influential. Prelaunch interaction allows you to be more likable.

6. Events/Ritual - Turning a launch into an event that people participate in together taps into our desire for shared experiences.

7. Community - You can build a community norm of engaging with and sharing your content during a launch. People want to conform.

 Here is a summary of the key points about the pre-prelaunch:

- The pre-prelaunch is the initial phase before the main prelaunch where you start generating anticipation and buzz for your upcoming product launch. 

- It typically consists of a single piece of content like an email, video, or blog post that hints at the launch coming soon.

- The goals are to prime your audience that something is coming, start building excitement and curiosity, and encourage people to opt-in to your prelaunch sequence.

- You want to be vague in the pre-prelaunch content, providing just enough details to intrigue people but not give everything away.

- The pre-prelaunch content should focus on the transformation or end result your product will provide rather than features. 

- It's important to include a clear call-to-action to opt-in to the prelaunch sequence to start building your prelaunch list.

- An effective pre-prelaunch generates buzz and gets people talking about the upcoming launch in anticipation.

- It sets the stage for a high-converting prelaunch sequence by priming your audience that something big is coming before you officially announce and open registration for the prelaunch.

In summary, the pre-prelaunch content is a critical first step in generating hype and interest before your main product launch campaign begins. When done well, it starts momentum and gets people excited for what's to come.

 Here is a summary of the key points about the Product Launch Formula pre-prelaunch phase:

- The pre-prelaunch is about starting to engage and build your audience (your "tribe") before the actual product launch. 

- It allows you to test interest in your product idea, surface potential objections to address later, and gather information to finalize your offer.

- The pre-prelaunch sets the stage for your main prelaunch sequence. 

- It's meant to grab attention without overtly selling anything yet. Tools used can include simple emails, social media, surveys, etc.

- Key goals are to arouse curiosity, make it collaborative, figure out objections, start a conversation without "corporate speak", make it fun and exciting, and stand out.

- A sample pre-prelaunch email starts conversation about the upcoming product without a sales pitch. It asks a favor - to answer survey questions that provide insight into crafting the offer.

- The pre-prelaunch naturally leads into the full prelaunch sequence as you build momentum towards the final product launch.

 Here are the key points I gathered from the summary:

- The pre-prelaunch is a sequence before the main prelaunch to generate interest and anticipation for the upcoming product launch. 

- It can be very simple, like a short email and survey asking for feedback on the upcoming product. This gets readers involved and engaged.

- The pre-prelaunch email hit on many of the key goals of a prelaunch, like building curiosity, getting help creating the product, identifying objections, starting a conversation, and standing out. 

- The survey asked readers for their top two questions about the product topic to get insight into objections and desires. 

- The pre-prelaunch sequence lead naturally into the main prelaunch by continuing the conversation and relationship with readers.

- This particular pre-prelaunch was very simple but generated $110,000 in sales for the author's first information product launch. It showcases how effective even a basic pre-prelaunch can be.

 Here are a few key points summarizing the prelaunch section so far:

- The prelaunch sequence is a critical part of the Product Launch Formula, as it builds relationship and value with prospects before asking for the sale. 

- Many businesses make the mistake of constantly shouting "Buy my stuff!" without first establishing trust and credibility. This rarely works in the noisy online world.

- Instead, the prelaunch sequence focuses on delivering value through free content and building a connection, following the principle of "giving before asking." 

- Giving valuable content digitally online is very affordable, so you can provide a lot of value at low cost.

- This content helps attract attention and build an audience organically, rather than having to "shout louder" than the competition. 

- Ultimately, this sets the stage for a successful launch by establishing you as an authority and trusted advisor ahead of the actual sales pitch.

 

- The Product Launch Formula involves creating a 3-part Prelaunch Sequence (PLC) to generate interest and anticipation for your product launch. 

- Each piece of Prelaunch Content (PLC) serves a specific purpose:
   - PLC #1 shows the opportunity/transformation the product provides.
   - PLC #2 provides solid teaching/information. 
   - PLC #3 gives an "ownership experience" and pivots to the product launch.

- The PLC follows an overall story arc, starting with the opportunity for change, providing teaching, then pivoting to the product launch. 

- Mental sales triggers like reciprocity, authority, trust, community, events/rituals, and anticipation are layered throughout the PLC.

- Video is a popular format for PLC, either screen-capture or full-motion video. 

- PLC #1 grabs attention by showing the transformation/opportunity the product provides. It should:
   - Show the opportunity/transformation
   - Position you as an authority
   - Teach valuable information 
   - Raise and address objections
   - Foreshadow PLC #2

- The key is focusing on the end result/transformation provided, not just the product features.

 Here are a few key points to keep in mind when planning the timing for your prelaunch sequence:

-Aim for 7-10 days total from the release of your first piece of prelaunch content to when you open cart and start taking orders. 

-Shorter sequences (5-7 days) tend to work better for lower priced products like ebooks.

-Longer sequences (8-10 days) allow more time to build desire and anticipation for higher priced products.

-Space out your 3 pieces of prelaunch content evenly over the full sequence. Don't bunch them all together at the beginning or end.

-The exact timing isn't as important as delivering highly valuable content and following the formula in each piece.

-Give your audience time to view, absorb and engage with each prelaunch content piece before releasing the next one. Don't rush it.

-Build excitement and address objections throughout to keep people engaged and prime them for your eventual launch offer.

The key is finding the right balance for your particular product, audience and goals. Test different durations and spacing to see what converts best. Just make sure each prelaunch piece provides tremendous value!

 

- The launch day is the culmination of all your hard work preparing for the product launch. It's an exhilarating feeling when you finally push the "send" button to open your cart and start selling. 

- The launch focuses a lot of accumulated energy and attention on this day. If done right, you've gotten your audience excited and anticipating this moment. 

- The emotions and energy on launch day are at a peak for both you and your audience. It's an unforgettable feeling, like the rush of a space launch.

- In the hours leading up to launch, you'll start to get a sense of the anticipation building if your pre-launch sequence was effective. People will start asking detailed questions about the offer itself. 

- Despite a strong pre-launch, you'll still have some doubts about whether people will actually buy. But once sales start coming in, it's an incredible feeling.

- The key is to build up energy and anticipation ahead of time with your pre-launch sequence. That makes launch day extremely powerful. It's the payoff for all your hard work.

 

- On launch day, open your shopping cart by sending an email to your list directing them to your sales page (either a video sales letter or written sales letter). 

- Before launching, thoroughly test every step of the order and fulfillment process. 

- Expect to feel anxious before launching - this is normal. 

- In the first few hours, monitor stats like traffic, conversions, etc. But don't get too obsessed, pull yourself away within a couple hours.

- Keep your launch open for 4-7 days typically. About 25% of sales come on day 1 due to anticipation built up. About 50% come at the end due to scarcity kicking in.

- It's critical to have a definitive close to your launch, with some negative consequence if people don't buy in the allotted time (e.g. price increase, loss of bonuses, offer disappears). This scarcity effect can double your results.

- The most powerful type of scarcity is when the offer disappears entirely after the launch window closes. But this doesn't work for all offer types.

In summary, launch day is the culmination of your prelaunch buildup. Have everything ready, create real scarcity, and monitor just enough stats to ensure things are working then get back to your launch. The close should generate a major spike in sales.

 Here are the key points from the summary:

- Using scarcity tactics like limiting availability, raising prices, or removing bonuses can create urgency and increase conversions during a launch. Layering multiple scarcity tactics can make the launch even more powerful. 

- It's important to keep emailing your launch list daily during the open cart period, not just at the beginning and end. Send multiple emails on the closing day to capitalize on procrastinators.

- Technical issues like crashing your website server or payment processing problems can happen during big launches. Take preventative steps like choosing launch-friendly providers.

- If you get no sales, diagnose possible issues with your offer, sales message, website functionality, and traffic. Tweaking your offer or sales copy mid-launch can sometimes turn things around. 

- After your launch, focus on strengthening relationships with buyers through great post-purchase experience and content. Non-buyers often still have goodwill, so continue nurturing them too. Use the momentum from your successful launch to keep growing your business.

 

- The "Seed Launch" allows you to create a business from almost nothing. Tara used it to go from a list of 200 people and no product to making almost $3,000 in initial sales. This then grew into a business doing over $500,000 in sales. 

- The Seed Launch involves selling your product or service before you create it. You collect payment upfront, then use the feedback from initial customers to shape the final product. 

- It can work even if you don't yet have a product or an email list. You can start small and build over time. 

- Jeff Walker used a Seed Launch himself when a business partnership ended abruptly. He focused on identifying his ideal new niche and the value he could provide. 

- He launched to a small list, making his first sales with no product created yet. This generated momentum and gave him credibility in his new niche of info marketing.

- The Seed Launch allowed Jeff to restart after a business disaster and ultimately grow his business into a multi-million dollar enterprise. 

- It shows that you can start small but eventually build a substantial business through successive product launches and list growth. The Seed Launch provides the initial spark.

 

- The author had expertise in marketing/product launches but no list or product in that niche. He gave a talk at a conference, offered a workshop afterward, and sold 6 spots.

- To get more participants, he invited entrepreneur friends for free. This brought the class size to over 30. 

- He used student feedback to shape the workshop content, avoiding the "curse of knowledge." Students guided what he taught.

- This process resulted in a great product attuned to the market's needs, leading to strong testimonials.  

- The Seed Launch utilizes two leverage points: smaller lists are more responsive, and every list has "hyper-responsives" who eagerly buy.

- The first step is building a micro-list of even just 30-100+ people via social media. This kickstarts the launch.

- The Seed Launch is flexible for information products and leverages small list responsiveness and hyper-responsives to create a tuned product with student input.

 

- The goal of the Seed Launch is to get you in the game, help you automatically create a great product, and learn about your market. It sets the stage for bigger launches down the road. 

- For your offer, do a series of 3-5 teleseminars on your topic. Plan for 30+ people to attend. Price can vary widely based on topic and audience.

- Use a pre-prelaunch to survey your micro-list on their needs/questions. Use this to shape your teleseminar content. 

- Record the calls and transcribe them into a multimedia product (audio + ebook).

- Survey attendees before and after each call to refine your content. This provides invaluable market research. 

- Focus on getting clients results and case studies. These will be useful for future, bigger launches. 

- The Seed Launch gets you paid to create a product and learn about your market. It sets the stage for much larger launches in the future.

 Here is a summary of the key points from the excerpt:

- The author was launching a new online business after his prior business failed due to a partnership breakup. He wanted complete control this time. 

- He was entering the crowded internet marketing niche, where he had no presence despite his online business experience. 

- His secret weapon was the "JV Launch" - partnering with established internet marketing experts to access their email lists and customer bases. 

- He had built relationships with industry leaders years earlier, helping them with product launches. This sowed the seeds for partnerships.

- For his launch, JV partners mailed their lists directing people to his squeeze page to build his list fast. 

- In a few days he built a list of over 15,000 from his partners' lists - far faster growth than possible on his own. 

- He felt pressure to deliver results for his JV partners who had trusted him with their support.

- Just before launch he was stressed, running on little sleep, but knew he had a great product and launch strategy. The stakes were high playing on this bigger stage.

 

- Jeff Walker had great success with his first product launch, generating over $600,000 in sales in the first week. This was accomplished through Joint Venture (JV) relationships, without spending anything on advertising.

- JV partners promote your product launch to their email lists, in exchange for a commission on any sales generated. Commissions vary but 50% is common for information products with high margins. 

- The power of JV launches comes from leveraging the email lists and audiences of others. This allows access to large, responsive groups of potential buyers.

- JV partners want to promote offers that will produce strong results and commissions for them. A well-structured launch sequence converts very well and generates higher than usual commissions (measured by EPC).

- Always test your offer first with an internal launch to your own list before involving JV partners. You don't want to risk damaging important partner relationships by promoting an untested offer.

- Getting great JV partners requires building long-term win-win relationships, not just looking for a quick promotion. Nurture relationships by providing value, communicating consistently, and over-delivering on your launches.

 

- Ruth Buczynski runs the National Institute for the Clinical Application of Behavioral Medicine (NICABM), which provides continuing education for health professionals through live conferences. 

- After 9/11, people cut back on business travel, which hurt NICABM's primary revenue source of live conferences. While still profitable, the business was struggling.

- Ruth hired Jeff Walker to help her transition her business model to digital information products. 

- Using the Business Launch Formula, they created a membership site with online courses, shifting NICABM's model from live events to digital training.

- The launch generated over $1 million in sales in just 6 days. NICABM's revenue doubled from the previous year.

- The digital model allowed NICABM to scale dramatically, going from 1,000 conference attendees to over 100,000 members.

- This case study demonstrates the power of the Business Launch Formula to reinvent or relaunch an existing business by shifting to a digital model and leveraging product launches.

- Key takeaways are that the launch formula can help transform a business, generate quick revenue, and allow for greater scale and reach.

 

- The Business Launch Formula (BLF) takes the Product Launch Formula (PLF) to the next level by using it to build or grow an entire business. 

- With BLF, entrepreneurs use a series of successful PLF launches to continually grow their business. Each launch brings in revenue but also expands their market reach and list size, allowing them to create new products, services, and membership sites.

- BLF entrepreneurs launch new products multiple times per year, using each launch to stimulate conversation with their audience to get ideas for the next launch. 

- Examples of entrepreneurs using BLF include John Gallagher, who went from food stamps to a six-figure business by continually launching new herbal products and services. Susan Garrett grew her dog training business from a small local operation to a large online business with BLF. 

- The key is to use each launch to build positioning, grow your list, increase recurring revenue with continuity programs, and spark ideas for the next launch - creating a cycle of business growth with each new launch.

 

- Deliver high-value prelaunch content in your launches to build relationships and create raving fans, even if they don't buy right away. 

- Constantly build your email list and nurture relationships with subscribers. Your list is your most valuable asset. 

- Make multiple product offers, ideally 2-4 launches per year. This creates momentum.

- Follow the "Circle of Awesome" - start with a Seed Launch to test an idea, follow up with an Internal Launch to your own list, and then do a big JV Launch leveraging partners. 

- Reinvest profits into improving your offers, providing even more value, and building your list. This compounds growth.

- Systematize and document your launch process so you can replicate it. Build a team to scale.

- Stay focused on your big vision and purpose. Use launches to incrementally move toward your larger goals.

The key is to continually provide value, build relationships and scale your business through a systematic launch process. Momentum compounds over time.

 Here are the key points from the chapters on creating a business you love:

- Figure out your "Big Why" - the deeper purpose behind your business beyond just making money. This gives you motivation and focus.

- Attract the right clients who resonate with you and your offers. Use marketing to connect with people who are a good fit. Not all clients are created equal.

- Design your business around your ideal lifestyle. Think about your ideal schedule, location, team, etc. and set up systems and processes to support this lifestyle. 

- Automate what you can so you aren't trapped working in your business. This gives you freedom.

- Make your business unique and remarkable. Stand out by specializing, having a strong brand and community, being the best, etc.

- Build a great team and empower them to do their best work. Surround yourself with talented people who share your vision.

- Focus on continual improvement rather than perfection. Tweak and refine things over time.

The key is to intentionally design your business around your Big Why, ideal clients, vision for lifestyle, and strengths. This allows you to love what you do and live life on your terms.

 Here are a few key points from the text:

- Look beyond immediate obstacles and keep your vision focused on the long-term goals and direction of your business. Don't get distracted by every new tactic or sacrifice your brand for a quick dollar. 

- Join a mastermind group of like-minded entrepreneurs to share ideas, brainstorm, and hold each other accountable. The right group provides immense value through the cross-pollination of ideas and community support.

- Opportunity cost - weighing potential choices by being aware of what you have to give up when pursuing a particular path - is hugely important, especially as your business grows. Time is often the biggest opportunity cost.

- Be a perpetual student. Successful entrepreneurs constantly learn and educate themselves as markets, clients, and competitors evolve. 

- Build strong relationships in your industry rather than viewing others as competitors. There is immense value in connecting with peers.

The key message is that long-term vision, community, continual learning, and relationships are critical to ongoing success as an entrepreneur. Sacrificing these for short-term wins can undermine the business.

 

- Jeff started his career working for Motorola after college, but quickly realized he didn't fit into the corporate world. After a few years, he quit his job to stay home with his young kids. 

- He had always dreamed of starting his own business, even from a young age, but had no role models or frame of reference for how to do it. 

- Years later, after creating a successful online business with the Product Launch Formula, Jeff was able to move his family to Durango, Colorado - a place he fell in love with years before on a drive out West after college.

- His online business allows him to work from anywhere with an internet connection. He has the freedom to live where he wants, work when he wants, and enjoy the outdoors in Durango with his family. 

- He attributes his success to the business he built using the Product Launch Formula. Many of his students have also achieved similar lifestyle freedom.

- It started with an ideal life visioning exercise before starting his first business. This vision of the ideal life he wanted set up his success. It's about getting clear on the business and life you want, not just going through the motions.

In summary, Jeff went from feeling like a misfit in the corporate world to building a successful online business that allows him the freedom to live where he wants and work when he wants. The key was defining his ideal life vision and then building a business aligned with that vision using the Product Launch Formula.

 Here's a summary of the key points:

- The author created a vision list of everything he wanted in his ideal future life. He was surprised that within a couple years, he had achieved nearly everything on the list. This showed him the power of clearly defining your goals and vision.

- As an entrepreneur, your real security comes from your ability to create value, not from a paycheck. Develop your business skills, especially marketing and sales using PLF (perfect life formula).  

- Take time away from work to recharge - "sharpen the saw." Don't just work nonstop. Take care of your body and mind like they are a million-dollar racehorse.

- As an entrepreneur, you'll have bigger highs and lows - like living in the Himalayas. Develop strategies to pull yourself out of lows, like exercise, meditation, being in nature, serving others. Stay grateful.

- Identify your "genius zone" - the things you are uniquely great at. Focus your time and energy there. Outsource or delegate the things you aren't as good at. This will lead to success.

 

- Do more of the activities that are in your "genius zone" - the things you are uniquely excellent at. Outsource or automate other tasks. 

- Your most scarce resource is your focus and attention. Don't let distractions like your phone pull you away from your most important work. 

- Start your day by working on your highest-value activities before getting caught up in other people's agendas. 

- Choose clients you love working with. You control who your clients are through your marketing and offerings. 

- You can't build anything great alone. Hire team members who are stars - the top 1% in their field. 

- As you become more successful, get better at saying "no" to preserve your time and energy for the most aligned opportunities.

- Abundance mindset is better than scarcity mindset. Helping others can bring good things back to you.

 Here are a few key points I gathered from the summary:

- The Product Launch Formula (PLF) has been proven successful thousands of times and has generated over $500 million in sales for Jeff Walker's clients. 

- PLF is based on enduring marketing strategies and principles, not fleeting tactics. Things like building connections, anticipation, social proof, authority, etc. will always work even as specific tactics change over time. 

- In the 1990s, Jeff bought an info product called "Turn Your Computer Into a Money Machine" which opened up the world of online business to him. Though it took time, it set him on the path to success.

- Taking that first step and buying that product was a pivotal moment for Jeff, much like standing at a fork in the road. It launched him down the entrepreneurial path.

- The PLF strategies in this book can similarly launch readers down the path to building successful online businesses if they take action and implement what they've learned.

In summary, the key message is that while tactics come and go, the core strategies of PLF endure and can create amazing success for those who put them into action. This system has created massive success for others, and now it's the reader's turn to launch.

 See Virtual Assistant in this glossary.

Auto-responder: An auto-responder or autoresponder is an email software program that immediately sends prewritten email messages to new subscribers when they opt-in to your list. It then continues to drip other messages to them over time. AWeber is the most popular autoresponder service. 

Backend: In the context of a product launch, your backend consists of any additional offers that you provide to customers during or after your launch. These are typically higher-priced premium offers that expand on the content or training from the frontend offer. Backend offers are a key strategy for maximizing revenue from your launch. Examples of typical backend offers include live coaching programs, mastermind groups, licensing rights, or done-for-you services.

Conversion Rate: The percentage of website visitors that take a desired action on

your site, such as buying your product or subscribing to your list. For

example, if 100 people visit your site and 10 buy your product, you have

a 10 percent conversion rate.

Crowdfunding: The practice of funding a project by raising small amounts of money from a large number of people, typically via the Internet and social media. The most popular crowdfunding platform is Kickstarter. Crowdfunding is effective for pre-selling products before development and for funding new product ideas.

Dime Sale: A specific type of discount campaign popularized by copywriter John Carlton, in which he offers his newsletter archive for 10 cents (a dime) for a limited period. It utilizes price as bait to attract a flood of new buyers/subscribers.

176





Downsell: An offer for a lower-priced product that you present immediately after a visitor declines your initial offer (known as an upsell or one-time offer). For example, if someone opts not to buy your $197 info product, you might down sell them on a $47 book or short report covering the same topic at a more introductory level.

DRM: Digital rights management. A system for controlling access to digital content and restricting what actions purchasers can take with the files you provide. DRM protects your intellectual property but also frustrates some customers. Solutions like SendOwl provide DRM.

Early Bird Discount: A discount offered to customers who buy early during a launch. You may provide an extra discount for the first 24 or 48 hours of a launch to create a further sense of urgency to buy immediately.

Engagement: Active involvement with your business, brand, or messaging. Social media engagement includes actions like commenting, sharing, tagging, and generally interacting with your content. Engaged email subscribers open and click your broadcasts. Engaged webinar attendees ask questions and post comments. High engagement leads to sales.

Evergreen: An evergreen product is one that sells year-round, as opposed to only during launches. Customers can purchase it at any time on your site. Evergreen products are the goal of a mature product launch business.

Follow-up Sequence: A series of automated emails that you send to new subscribers over a period of days or weeks after they initially join your list. The follow-up sequence nurtures subscribers and builds the know, like and trust necessary to eventually sell them products. (Also called onboarding sequence.) 

Funnel: A strategic series of website pages designed to convert visitors into buyers. A typical e-commerce funnel would progress site visitors through pages like: squeeze page > sales letter > order form. The goal is to move visitors further down the funnel toward a sale with each additional page they view.

Home Study Course: A digital learning program that customers access online, consisting of training videos, audio lessons, PDF workbooks and other materials that can be downloaded or accessed through a membership site. A home study course can be launched just like any other info product.

JV Partner: A joint venture (JV) partner. Another business owner or marketer who promotes your launch to their audience, usually in exchange for a commission on referred sales. JV partners are essential for amplifying your results.

Launch: The coordinated promotion of a new product through a concentrated time-based marketing campaign, utilizing strategies like early bird discounts, bonuses, contests, and JV partners to generate excitement and buyer urgency. 177





Launch Jacking: An unethical practice in which one marketer attempts to piggyback promotion of their competing product on the coattails of another marketer’s launch. For example, sending email promotions about a similar product with subject lines like “Forget Product XYZ, buy this instead.”

Lead Magnet: A free offer used as an ethical bribe to entice people to subscribe to your email list, such as a report, video, checklist, resource guide, sample, etc. For example, “Get my free social media image guide when you subscribe to my list.” 

Membership Sites: Websites that customers pay to access restricted content

on an ongoing basis, usually monthly or annually. Additional revenue stream for a business.

Metrics: The various statistics, analytics, and measurable data points that provide insight into the performance and profitability of a business.

Niche: A specialized target audience that you create products and marketing for.

The more tightly defined the niche, the better. For example, “divorced women over 40 struggling with loneliness” is a good niche. “Women” is too broad.

One-Time Offer: An offer for an additional product that is displayed immediately after a customer completes the purchase of your main offer. For example, when they complete your $97 purchase, they are presented with a one-time offer to add Product B for just $67 more. Known as an upsell outside of launches. 

Outsourcing: Delegating tasks and projects to skilled freelancers rather than completing them yourself. Sites like Upwork allow you to easily find and hire talent. Key strategy for solopreneurs.

Pay What You Want: A flexible pricing model in which customers can choose what price they want to pay for your product, including $0. Limits required minimum to prevent abuse. Used successfully for launches.

Pre-Launch: The 1-4 week period prior to the official start of a launch when you begin building momentum, teasing the upcoming event, and opening up to early bird customers. Soft launch.

Sales Copy: The written content on your website designed to persuade visitors to make a purchase. Includes elements like the headlines, bullets, testimonials, storytelling, etc. Good persuasive sales copy boosts conversions.

Shopping Cart: The checkout system on an e-commerce site that handles credit cards, processes orders and collects customer information. Popular carts include 1ShoppingCart, SamCart, ClickFunnels.

Solopreneur: An entrepreneur who is running a business entirely on their own, without employees. Leverages outsourcing. 178





Squeeze Page: A website page whose sole purpose is to entice visitors

to opt-in to your email list by offering them something of value like a

report or video. Contains little content other than a headline, bullets on

the offer, and an opt-in form. Should link to a sales page. (Also called opt-in page or lead capture page.)

Teaser Video: A 1-3 minute video that provides a tempting preview of your product but withholds all the critical details. Posted in the weeks before a launch to generate excitement.

Testimonial: A positive statement from a customer about their experience with your product or service. Credibility booster. Testimonials can be quotes, written case studies, or video.

Theme: The unifying concept or big idea behind your launch. Examples:

Transformation, Breakthrough, Unleashed, Ascend. Used in your launch branding, messaging, and naming. Sets strategic direction.

Upsell: See One-Time Offer above.

Virtual Assistant: A freelancer who provides administrative, creative, and technical services to entrepreneurs as requested in exchange for an hourly, daily, or monthly fee. Allows solopreneurs to delegate tasks. English-speaking VAs are readily available sites like Upwork or Fiverr.

Webinar: A seminar or workshop that is conducted live over the internet using a platform like GoToWebinar. Webinar attendees watch on their computer and can interact via chat or audio. Webinars are used extensively in launches for training and Q&A sessions. Can also be recorded or automated for replay.

For almost 20 years he’s been creating hugely successful online launches and promotions that have generated hundreds of millions in sales for his products, his students, and other online businesses.
