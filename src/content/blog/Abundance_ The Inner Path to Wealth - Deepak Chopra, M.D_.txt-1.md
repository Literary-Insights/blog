- The book aims to provide an inner spiritual path to achieving abundance and handling money, rather than just offering external advice on how to make more money. 

- It suggests abundance is a state of awareness, drawing on yoga concepts that see uniting the inner and outer worlds. 

- Part 1 addresses money and wealth from a yoga perspective. Part 2 covers all aspects of abundance beyond just finances. Part 3 examines the chakra system and how to access higher consciousness.

- The author argues that true wealth comes from connecting with generosity of spirit within, not material desires alone. Happiness and success arise from an inner state of joy and harmony, not from outward circumstances. 

- Yoga is a science of consciousness that can create personal transformation by changing one's awareness and harmonizing life's inner and outer aspects. 

- When the inner and outer are in alignment through yoga, what one needs and desires also come into harmony, and abundance results from embodying virtues like infinite creativity and giving. True wealth involves more than just money.


- Dharma and following one's dharma leads to abundance and fulfillment rather than scarcity. Dharma supports being happy, giving to others, making others' success a priority, acting with love, living by ideals, being peaceful, inspiring others, self-reliance, open-mindedness, and self-acceptance. 

- Modern life often leads us away from dharma by encouraging stress, distraction, selfishness, blaming others, desperation for money over happiness, domination of others, and taking more than giving. 

- To stay on one's dharma path, one should avoid being selfish, dishonest, blaming others, prioritizing money over happiness, ignoring others' needs, being closed-minded, and taking more than giving. 

- Creating a "soul profile" by answering questions about one's purpose and authentic self can help reveal one's dharma and connect one to deeper awareness and inspiration, leading to fulfillment and wealth while staying on one's dharma path. Consulting one's true self through deeper understanding is critical to remaining in dharma.


- The passage discusses the concept of karma and how it relates to wealth, success, and life outcomes. It suggests that as you are internally, so your external world reflects. 

- Karma refers to the leftover results of past actions (cause and effect). It aims to explain 'good luck' and 'bad luck' experiences that can't be accounted for by rational reasons alone. 

- Karma is not a fateful force beyond our control, but rather the unforeseen consequences of our past actions. It is woven into the complex web of cause and effect. 

- On a practical level, one's karma can be understood as habitual behaviors, automatic reactions, unconscious patterns, character traits, and innate dispositions - things mostly outside our conscious control. 

- By becoming conscious of habitual patterns and karma, one gains the power to live consciously rather than unconsciously, and thus change their circumstances over time through intentionally altering causes (actions). Knowing karma is critical to manifesting wealth, health, and other desired life outcomes.

 Here are the key points about the power of unconscious behavior and improving money karma:

- Unconscious habits formed over the years can have a powerful influence on our behaviors, even if no direct karmic mystery is involved. Unconscious patterns drive things like overeating.

- There needs to be more than being aware of problems to change behavior. One must increase awareness at the level of solutions. Examining issues more closely is required to find practical solutions. 

- Common strategies like struggling against bad habits or berating oneself do not work and often worsen the problem. A truce is needed between warring internal impulses. 

- Karma is not inevitable and can change through increased self-awareness. The remedy for getting unstuck is always by expanding awareness. 

- Money problems are often driven by unconscious habits and past conditioning, leading to unhelpful behaviors like worry, denial, etc. But awareness of positive choices like honesty, persistence, responsibility can improve money karma.

- A process is outlined for improving money karma through calm reflection, choosing positive actions, finding answers from one's true self, and acting on the insights gained from increased awareness. 

- There is also a collective "double bind" around money created by social dynamics, but one's karma and choices can still be influenced through greater consciousness.

So in summary, habitual unconscious patterns influence behaviors like overspending, but increased self-awareness at the level of solutions provides a way to positively change habits and improve one's money karma over time.


The passage discusses issues related to money, work and job satisfaction. It argues that while job satisfaction is high according to surveys, many people are still struggling or just getting by. 

People adapt themselves to fit their jobs rather than following their passions. The most satisfying jobs are not necessarily the highest paying - clergy is ranked #1 while doctors are #11. 

Key factors that contribute to job satisfaction are adequate pay, low stress, job security, good relationships, opportunities for growth and being good at one's job. Individuals can take steps to improve these factors or find a new job if the environment is poor. 

Money alone does not lead to happiness - one should be paid fairly for their work. Unfair wages are a top cause of dissatisfaction. Debt and materialism can also undermine satisfaction with money. 

Stress is a significant factor - it stems from workload, deadlines, noise, and insecurity. Individuals should address their own stressors and avoid causing stress for others. 

Job security is also a fundamental anxiety. Small businesses tend to care more for employees than large corporations during downturns. Overall clarity and prudent assessment of one's work situation are recommended.


This passage discusses several factors to consider when evaluating a job or career, including job security, savings and financial preparedness for retirement, relationships with coworkers, opportunities to be heard and supported by management, ability to care for others, chances for advancement, and company culture. 

Some key points made include:
- Job security varies by industry, with less protection in fields like restaurants than in government work. 
- Most Americans are not financially prepared for retirement based on expert recommendations for savings by age. Personal responsibility and awareness of one's financial situation are emphasized.
- Maintaining good relationships with coworkers through respect, cooperation and avoiding gossip is essential.  
- Feeling heard is a significant factor in job satisfaction, and lack of listening from managers is a red flag.
- Loyalty from higher-ups is essential to balance the hierarchy in most work structures. 
- Jobs providing opportunities to care for others correlate with high satisfaction. 
- Opportunities for advancement have declined in the US but are essential to consider, though individual and systematic barriers exist.
- Positive company cultures that benefit workers should be sought after.

The passage discusses many practical factors to consider when evaluating job satisfaction, security and career advancement potential. Personal responsibility for financial preparedness is also stressed.


- Creative intelligence is a dynamic aspect of consciousness that drives humans to engage in creation and discovery. Early hominins like Homo erectus could consciously tap into creative intelligence over a million years ago when they first domesticated fire. 

- Some of the earliest examples of human creativity include counting systems using notched stones from the Neolithic era and controlling fire around 1-2 million years ago. This shows creative intelligence does not require a giant brain.

- Money evolved as a way for humans to add value and meaning through trade and exchange. Our impulse to grow and discover new things brings us joy, as seen in children learning and adults in love. 

- In physics, the universe is pulled between two opposite forces - evolution that creates more complex structures, and entropy that breaks things down. Similarly, human consciousness is pulled between evolving through discovery and creativity, versus entropy forces like war, disease and psychosis.

- Overall, the text discusses how creative intelligence is a natural aspect of human consciousness that has driven innovation, discovery and evolution for over a million years, through the innate human impulse to learn, create and add value/meaning to our lives.


- The flow of creative intelligence constantly drives evolution, including the development of money and commerce over the past 5,000 years. Progress always has an associated cost or "price tag."

- Inside each person, entropy refers to factors that sap creative intelligence, like unconscious behavior, habits, conditioning, inertia, close-mindedness, and passive inertia. 

- Most people exist in the middle of the "human condition bell curve," with a mix of entropy and evolution in their lives due to many unconscious choices and impulses. 

- It's possible to increase conscious choices and evolve towards the curve's right edge where geniuses/visionaries exist in a highly developed pure consciousness. 

- Money can evolve or produce waste, depending on whether entropic or creative choices are made. 

- Seven common "entropic" money mistakes are listed, like fantasizing about money, fear of poverty, dishonesty, betraying values, abusing others, and an obsession with "winning."

- Seven factors that "actually work" regarding money are listed, like self-sufficiency, responsibility, cooperation, the right work ethic, being true to oneself, faithful values, and focusing on awareness. 

- Outlining what works/doesn't work regarding money is practical, as most people stick to non-working behaviors out of habit without knowing why. The best way to earn and use money is on the path of evolution.


- Creative intelligence and conscious exploration are essential for progress, like how toddlers learn skills through trial and error despite risks of failure. An inner drive guides our language, motor skills, and higher thought development. 

- Connecting with our "creative intelligence" leads to discoveries and achievements, as Einstein noted about wonder inspiring science. There are new worlds opened by wonder expanding to meet them.

- Simple awareness is a powerful engine for change. Our attitudes are entangled with desires, dreams and goals. Broadening perspective with yoga teachings shows how consciousness clarity reveals the path forward. 

- "Dharma" or truth constantly signals the following needed change. Insights instantly motivate change. Deeper insights impacting lives include realizing one's worth and belonging. 

- Simple awareness is the calm gap between thoughts. It feels quiet, content, relaxed, and complete. Glimpsed through leisure, art or nature, it naturally calls the mind to its source in the soul. 

- Negative emotions, repetition and beliefs pull us from simple awareness into the past. Centering practices like controlled breathing restore calm presence. Investigating where limiting beliefs came from can also help shift perspective.


- Negative self-beliefs can stem from things others have told us, especially when we were young. We should question why we automatically trusted those opinions. 

- Memories of bad past experiences can keep us stuck if we hold on to the negative emotions associated with them. Various mindfulness techniques like deep breathing, visualization, and emotional release practices can help discharge these "emotional debts" from the past.

- Having an attitude of abundance rather than lack is essential for fulfillment, even more than material wealth. An abundant mindset changes our expectations, behavior and sense of identity. 

- Many people silently identify with limitation without confronting their underlying attitude of lack. This attitude is shaped by habits of caution, fearing expansion, and defining ourselves by past failures. 

- A quiz is provided to help assess where someone currently falls regarding attitudes of abundance versus lack. Agreeing with statements reflecting lack or neutral/disagreeing with abundance statements indicates room for growth.

The overall message is that negative self-beliefs, memories, and underlying attitudes can keep us stuck in the past and feeling limited. But through questioning old assumptions, releasing emotional baggage, and cultivating an abundant mindset, we can gain insights and shift our perceptions to feel more fulfilled.

 

- Having an attitude of abundance means believing that opportunities and fulfillment are readily available if you look for them and align your mindset accordingly. 

- Fulfillment comes from within through changing your beliefs and behaviors, not from external factors alone. It involves living in the present, acting generously, taking responsibility for your emotions, renouncing blame, being creative, responding from the Heart, and embracing self-appreciation. 

- The Japanese concept of "Ikigai" means having a reason for being and fulfilling your potential in love, skills, lifestyle, and service to others. 

- Ancient Indian teachings identified four aims of life - material prosperity, love/pleasure fulfillment, moral living, and spiritual liberation - all of which are necessary for a balanced life. 

- True abundance and fulfillment cannot be reduced to commercial transactions or material gains alone. They come from acting with meaning and purpose from within, not from checking boxes of desirable external qualities. 

- An attitude of abundance recognizes that all fulfillment we could need is already present within ourselves and the natural world through our human capabilities and potentiality. The key is changing one's mindset and behaviors accordingly.


- The passage discusses the power of subtle intention or "Sankalpa" in yoga philosophy to manifest desires from the invisible to visible world. It recognizes no separation between the inner and outer worlds. 

- Common limiting beliefs about "real life" are discussed, such as life being unfair or random—these lower expectations. 

- Sankalpa works through attention and intention. Focusing on something causes it to grow, and the deepest purposes are automatically fulfilled through self-organization. 

- For intentions about external outcomes to succeed, certain "right conditions" must be met, like having a clear purpose, being in one's dharma, and wanting the best product. 

- "Wrong conditions" that can interfere include mixed intentions, transient desires, lack of awareness, intentions that harm others, or not letting the process unfold naturally. 

- The key is forming an intention once then letting it go with openness to how it may manifest, rather than interfering. Inattention and past karma can also be obstacles if choices are not fulfilled.

In summary, the passage discusses how subtle intention or Sankalpa can manifest desires through aligning with creative intelligence if certain clarity, awareness, and benefit conditions are met.


- The chakra system maps the flow of creative intelligence through 7 energy centers along the spine. Each chakra expresses a different quality.

- The seven chakras and their associated qualities are the Crown (bliss), Third Eye (intelligence), Throat (expression), Heart (love), Solar Plexus (action), Sacral (pleasure), and Root (security).

- You can meditate on a chakra to strengthen its quality by focusing on the associated mantra. Mantras include So Hum, Om, Ham, Yam, Ram, Vam, Lam. 

- Basic chakra meditation involves sitting comfortably, breathing, focusing on the chakra location, and silently repeating the mantra for 10-20 minutes. 

- You can also meditate on "centering thoughts" related to each chakra's quality, like "I am" for Crown or "I am love" for Heart. 

- The goal is to align with and strengthen the seven gifts of creative intelligence through meditating on the chakras using mantras or intentions. This allows creative intelligence to organize one's experience.


The passage discusses meditating on intentions and using the chakra system for inner growth and evolution. It notes that meditating on a meaning involves fully identifying with and believing the intention statement, rather than just repeating a mantra. Examples of purposes related to different chakras include the root chakra saying "I am always safe and secure." 

When meditating on an intention, various thoughts, feelings, memories may arise in response. These are like layers separating you from the core belief in the sense. Simple awareness helps melt away these layers. Over time, through continued practice, the intention statement will feel believable and connected to one's true self. 

The passage explains how the chakra system can be used for inner evolution beyond meditation. Each chakra quality, like creativity or love, contains the potential for strengthening and expressing itself in new ways. This allows one to follow an open-ended, self-directed evolutionary path of consciousness unfolding. 

The text then provides an in-depth discussion of the crown chakra and blissfulness, including how Joseph Campbell introduced "following your bliss" to inspire spiritual growth without religious terms. It notes some nuances around what one believes one "ought" to be doing with one's life based on social and familial influences.


- The passage discusses the concept of "I am enough" versus "I am not enough" as it relates to yoga's view of consciousness. 

- "I am enough" comes from recognizing one's connection to an infinite reservoir of bliss-consciousness. This is the unmoving state of consciousness that establishes wholeness. 

- "I am not enough" comes from relying only on the active mind and building an ego-based identity or story. The ego's agenda is driven by lack and separation from one's true nature. 

- Activating the crown chakra helps connect to bliss-consciousness and knowing "I am enough." Suggested ways to do this include cultivating generosity, giving of oneself, finding inspiration, and specific breathing exercises. 

- Recognizing one's wholeness and connection to the infinite source helps move beyond an ego-based identity of lack and separation into a sense of abundance and completeness.


- The sixth chakra in the forehead/third eye region relates to intelligence, knowledge, intuition and imagination. 

- However, modern rationality/reason has also enabled destructive weapons and technological harms to the environment due to prioritizing rational thinking over intuition. 

- Yoga regards intuition, insight and imagination as equally or more essential guides than rationality alone. Activating the sixth chakra involves developing these "subtler powers" of the mind. 

- Based on questionnaires assessing tendencies, most people favor either a "left-brain" rational/logical mindset or a "right-brain" intuitive/creative mindset. 

- An ideal state is to develop a "whole mind" that balances rationality and intuition/creativity through breathwork, meditation, and awareness cultivation. 

- Escaping attachment to one's dominant mindset allows openness to creative intelligence and a flexible, renewed state of awareness - the most accurate form of intelligence according to yoga.


- The mind assigns meaning and value to raw experiences based on the purposes and importance it has developed over a lifetime through thousands of occasions. This shapes one's mindset. 

- Jeanne developed a negative mindset towards Muslims after a traumatic experience with a Muslim girl as a young teacher. She holds all Muslims responsible for this one incident 40 years later. 

- The mindset is like a coral reef built up slowly over time through accumulating experiences. It is tough to change, especially after solid emotional experiences. 

- However, you don't need to change your mindset. You can bypass it by accessing a state of open awareness rather than responding based on your conditioned air. 

- The quiz assesses whether one thinks for themselves or conforms to others' opinions without independent thought. Thinking for oneself is the hallmark of successful thinkers, while conformity prevents independent and original thinking. Most people have a mixture of both tendencies.


- Conformity and going along to get along is sometimes more accessible, but it prevents true independent thinking. Nonconformity is associated with both social activism and radically new ideas. 

- It's difficult to value yourself as an original thinker when societal pressures push toward conformity out of fear of being seen as odd or an outlier. This is known as "tall poppy syndrome."

- Both ego and social programming limit thinking. Ego pushes for selfish agendas like impressing others, always being right, competition, etc. Social programming includes plans like teamwork, popularity, obedience to authority, groupthink, etc. 

- Ego and social programming lead people to automatic, unexamined thinking instead of independent thought—examples of how people's reactions differ depending on which agenda dominates their thinking. 

- True thinking requires moving beyond these programmed mindsets to a place of creative intelligence and wisdom that allows successful reflection in any situation, not just when it conforms or boosts ego/status. Independent thought is needed to avoid the excesses that programmed thinking can lead to.


- Wisdom is defined as creative intelligence - having an open mind, flexible responses, clear perceptions, unclouded thinking, lack of bias, and positive expectations. This allows for more effective problem solving compared to routine review. 

- The passage discusses exercises and techniques for developing intuition and activating the third eye/forehead chakra, strengthening the mind and abilities like intuition, insight, and imagination. 

- Simple awareness is emphasized as the key - becoming aware at a level where solutions exist to every problem and operating from that level of creative intelligence. 

- Intuition brings direct knowledge without reasoning, as seen in exercises like intuitively finding a lost object or distant viewing where one person looks at an image and the other tries to perceive it intuitively. 

- The "ask and you shall receive" exercise involves asking a problem be solved, detaching from the outcome, and expecting an intuitive answer overnight or in flashes of insight. 

- The fifth chakra of the Throat governs speech, self-expression, and truthfulness. Language has magical properties and one's life unfolds based on how words are used as expressions of creative intelligence rather than just brain activity.

In summary, the passage discusses how wisdom is creative intelligence and presents exercises for developing intuition and activating higher thought through awareness, meditation, and trusting one's innate creative abilities.


- Words can either promote good magic or evil magic in any situation. Good magic helps move things in a positive, fulfilling direction through truth, peace, understanding, cooperation, etc. Evil magic has the opposite effect. 

- It's essential to be aware of whether good or evil magic is occurring based on signals like body language, atmosphere, agreement/disagreement with what's being said, feelings of being heard/understood. 

- Words carry deeper implicit meanings and communicate things like mood, relationship dynamics, role, dominance/submission, understanding, and willingness to cooperate beyond their literal definition. 

- The throat chakra allows speaking freely without fear. But words are energized by the speaker's inner state - they must say from authenticity rather than fear, self-doubt, or disguising the truth. 

- The ego uses "magical lies" to maintain a strong self-image rather than live authentically from our true self. These lies influence our speech and behavior in hidden ways. We must be aware of the lies controlling us.

So in summary, it's about using words consciously and strategically to promote understanding, fulfillment and "good magic" rather than discord, through authentic self-expression and awareness of subtleties in communication.


- The passage discusses how everyone is engaged in constructing their own story or narrative about themselves, which often needs clarification on mixing past, present, and future. 

- It gives an example of how we make quick, unconscious decisions in conversation that shape our narrative, like responding "Fine" when asked how we slept. This single word conveys a lot. 

- Our personal stories exist more like "mental holograms" - a single detail can reflect the whole picture. Things like faces of loved ones or playing music can evoke complex associations. 

- The passage argues our true selves and creative intelligence shape our stories in ways beyond our conscious mental control. It's about allowing the right direction to emerge, not controlling the words themselves. 

- It provides behaviors that indicate projecting an "I am not enough" narrative like complaining or blaming others, and behaviors of an "I am enough" history like openness, generosity, optimism. 

- Upgrading our stories involves noticing default behaviors, stopping themselves, focusing on positive alternatives, and getting feedback from others on how they see us. This opens communication with our true selves.

- It then discusses how healthy communication is essential to relationships, but people genuinely want to feel heard and validated in the connection, beyond just the words themselves. Losing this thread of understanding leads relationships to unravel.


- The fourth chakra, located at the Heart, governs emotions. In its balanced state, it is the source of positive emotions like love, happiness, empathy and bonding. 

- Emotions are transformations of consciousness. Negative emotions indicate an imbalance in the flow of creative intelligence through the chakras. 

- Modern psychology has had limited success in curing depression and anxiety, the main obstacles to happiness. Drugs only treat symptoms, not the underlying causes. 

- Yoga offers a deeper understanding of how consciousness and emotions are connected. We have responsibility over our emotional well-being and choices. 

- While family upbringing influences emotional development, healing from past trauma happens internally through one's awareness practice. The goal is not to erase the past but heal from within by becoming both healer and healed. An imbalanced fourth chakra can lead to emotional poverty if not addressed.

 

- Self-awareness is essential to identify symptoms of emotional poverty like anxiety, short temper, difficulty expressing emotions, fear of intimacy, feeling embarrassed by emotions, etc. 

- Many people avoid exploring their emotions due to shame or seeking distractions. Healing begins by accepting an inner state of fulfillment is possible. 

- Symptoms of emotional richness include being in touch with emotions, trusting emotions to guide you, bouncing back from negative emotions, not clinging to anger/resentment, freely expressing love, etc. 

- Emotional healing is like blowing dust off a mirror to reflect bliss-consciousness. 

- A quiz is provided to assess how well one's inner child is doing based on questions about temperament, reactions to criticism/success of others, compassion, joy, etc. 

- Scoring more yes answers indicates a better evolved emotional life with understanding and acceptance. Less yes answers suggests one's inner child has a negative influence and it is harder to connect emotionally with others.

- While no one scores perfectly, the goal is to evolve emotionally from childhood impulses to a more mature, resilient state of freely expressing feelings open to one's and other's emotions.


- Human emotions provide both the best and worst moments in life. They allow us to experience a maximum diversity of feelings. 

- Positive and negative feelings are two sides of the same coin. You can't experience love without also experiencing its opposite - hate, jealousy, etc. 

- The origins and purposes of human emotions are mysterious. Animals display behaviors akin to feelings, but we can't know what they truly feel. 

- Primitive impulses like sex drive reside in the lower brain, but humans are unique in distrusting our basic instincts. Evolution may have caused this over millennia. 

- Emotions work against Darwinian survival principles by allowing care for the weak. Compassion is not rooted in higher primate behaviors either. 

- An ancient Indian text views all love as coming from a deeper Self or soul level. Emotions bond people at the level of consciousness.

- Unaddressed past emotional wounds accumulate as "emotional debt." Bad intentions coupled with negative emotions create this debt. 

- Emotional debt can stem from abuse, bullying, betrayal, lack of love, competition, favoritism, and more. 

- Healing requires understanding where debts came from and allowing emotions to wash away residue through experiences of joy, forgiveness, and the flow of creative intelligence.


- The intention is the key - make sure your choices are aligned with creative intelligence and are for the betterment of yourself and others. Example intentions listed include being happier, finding peace, being creative, etc. 

- Bad intentions like blaming, attacking, manipulating, controlling others should be avoided as they are destructive to relationships. 

- These negative tactics often stem from unresolved issues from childhood, like clinging to others due to insecurity. 

- If you catch yourself using these tactics, pause and return to a balanced state of awareness. Refuse to play the game if others use them on you. 

- Taking responsibility for your feelings rather than passing them along is essential. This gives space for creative intelligence to operate. 

- Trusting creative intelligence and discovering the wisdom of emotions through an open heart brings joy in feeling your way through life. 

- Activating the heart chakra involves being in simple awareness, meditating on mantras like "Yam", and thinking centering thoughts like "I am". This helps strengthen intuition, insight and imagination.

 Here is a summary of the key points about activating the heart chakra from the provided text:

- The heart chakra, or the 4th chakra, is associated with love, compassion, and connection to others. 

- Two meditations are described to help activate the heart chakra:
   - Meditation 1 involves remembering an experience of pure joy and happiness and focusing on the feeling of pleasure in one's Heart. 
   - Meditation 2 is a visualization where bright light flows from the crown chakra down to the heart chakra, filling the Heart with a blue or white light and feeling of bliss radiating outward.

- The goal is to contact a seed of loving or blissful emotion, then expand on that feeling through meditation to open the heart chakra. 

- Activating the heart chakra leads to experiencing feelings of warmth, love and joy through expanding one's bliss consciousness.

In summary, the text guides specific meditations individuals can practice to remember and cultivate feelings of love, joy, and bliss to open their heart chakra and activate the energy of love and compassion.


The passage discusses finding fulfillment through being in "the zone" or a state of simple awareness, rather than ego-driven doing and striving. It explains three aspects of being in the zone - witnessing one's actions without judgment, detachment through letting go of forcing outcomes, and non-doing by allowing creative intelligence to take over instead of interfering. 

It uses the example of Marianne Berchtold (Nannerl Mozart), Wolfgang Mozart's sister, who was also a child prodigy but wasted her gifts due to the limitations of 18th-century society for women. She was blind and mute in old age, while Mozart achieved fame and success before his early death. 

Overall, the passage encourages connecting to one's true self or "bliss consciousness" through simple awareness, trusting that fulfillment comes from being rather than doing driven by egoic desires. This allows creative intelligence to operate freely, leading to fruitful outcomes without stress or struggle.


- The passage discusses how Maria Anna Mozart would likely have had a comfortable old age if she lived today, as many common causes of blindness are now treatable. Mozart's actual cause of death is believed to have been rheumatic fever, which is now easily treatable. 

- Improvements in medical treatment would not necessarily help someone progress spiritually, as spiritual awakening depends on inner awareness rather than external circumstances. 

- The hidden spiritual path is equally available to all regardless of life circumstances or talents. Mozart's children benefited from wealthy patrons but spiritual progress requires inner work not external conditions. 

- Yoga offers a universal vision of human potential through spiritual awakening and living according to principles like fulfillment, lack of suffering, and infinite possibilities. 

- The passage provides suggestions for evolving daily through choices that reduce stress, improve surroundings, strengthen inspiration sources, and help others. This encourages personal growth and reversing entropy.

- Other tips involve focusing entirely without distraction, engaging in creativity daily, expanding possibilities through challenging projects, and activating the solar plexus chakra through awareness, meditation, and centering thoughts. 

The message is that spiritual progress depends on inner work like daily choices to reduce suffering and promote fulfillment, creativity, presence and personal growth. External conditions are not necessary barriers to spiritual awakening.


This page discusses being "in your power" or experiencing empowerment through desire and intention. It explains that desire is a natural and powerful motivator that can be channeled in either ego-driven or bliss-focused ways. 

When desires are ego-based, they perpetuate craving and lack. But they promote unity between intention and outcome when centered on expanding bliss. The passage describes techniques like Samyama meditation to develop this skill of manifesting intentions. 

It advocates focusing desires on blissful actions like love, generosity and growth rather than superficial wants. Actual needs are defined broadly as whatever supports bliss and evolution. Fulfillment comes through aligning with creative intelligence via "right mindfulness" - living mindfully in each moment with awareness of dharma. 

Overall, empowerment lies not in chasing every want, but in favoring blissful intentions that fulfill real needs and align one's desires with the positive flow of life. This shifts desire from an ego-driven force to a tool for union and manifestation according to one's highest good.


- The passage discusses the second chakra, associated with the five senses and pleasure/sensuality. 

- It notes there is pleasure in experiencing beautiful sights, sounds, tastes, etc. But some moralistic religions have viewed sensuality as sinful. 

- Modern society has moved away from such moralism. However, sensual pleasure can still lead to problems of excess like craving and addiction when used to end pain/suffering rather than experience bliss. 

- Pleasure and bliss are differentiated - pleasure comes from the senses while bliss is a higher state of consciousness. Craving satisfaction cannot achieve bliss. 

- A quiz is presented to assess how well one is meeting various life needs, relationship needs, and whether needs are being met poorly, reasonably well, or very well. Scoring is discussed.

- In summary, it examines the relationship between senses, pleasure, and bliss, noting pleasure alone cannot achieve a higher state of happiness if used to excess or satisfy cravings rather than experience life fully.


- Repetition is common to cravings and addictions. Starting with one piece of chocolate or drink leads to more and more consumption. 

- Repetition stems from using substances to numb anxiety or escape underlying issues. But it's futile in the long run due to diminishing returns. 

- Cravings and addictions arise because people lack access to inner bliss. Fulfillment comes from the feeling, not external things. Inner happiness is already there. 

- When pursuing desires, we are trying to recapture inner bliss. Expanding awareness naturally fulfills desire. 

- Relationships involve ego fantasies like demanding others change, feeling superior, and needing to win. These come from judgments and "us vs. them" thinking. 

- To improve relationships, take responsibility for change by discarding blame, letting go of controlling others, and focusing on shared fulfillment over ego needs. Use creative intelligence to turn "no" into "yes."


- The 1st chakra, located at the base of the spine, is about feeling connected to the Earth and grounded. It provides a secure foundation for the higher chakras. 

- Being grounded includes feeling comfortable in your body, physically safe, emotionally stable, not easily influenced by external factors, and being present in the here and now. 

- When the 1st chakra is balanced, the flow of bliss consciousness can move freely through the body and into the ground, creating a state of dynamic balance. 

- Being grounded is described as having a stable, down-to-earth, and reliable personality. It is the natural result of balance in the 1st chakra, not something to strive for actively. 

- With a grounded 1st chakra, one feels ultimately at home in the physical world and no longer fears it as inherently dangerous or unsafe. This represents a shift to seeing the world as a place of opportunity rather than risk.

So in summary, the 1st chakra provides the foundation of feeling grounded and connected to the physical world, allowing a free flow of bliss consciousness through the body and a sense of safety, stability, and presence.


- The passage discusses approaching life from a top-down perspective by prioritizing the crown chakra as one's source, rather than taking a bottom-up approach focused on material needs. 

- It argues that in nature, all animals nurture their young until ready, but humans extend this boosting into adolescence due to our consciousness-based development. 

- A story is shared of a man who experienced intense love and felt a mother's touch during meditation, connecting to the idea of a divine mother in spiritual traditions.

- Modern society has lost its connection to the Earth, and reconnecting physically and spiritually to nature can lead to transformative experiences. 

- A quiz is provided to assess how grounded one feels in their physical body and nature. Suggestions are made to strengthen this connection through habits like exercise, nature time, breathwork, and mind centering. 

- The passage argues for "right reality" where consciousness can alter physical reality, as seen in extraordinary cases like a monk whose body did not decay after being declared dead. Scientific observation was brought in to verify.


- A doctor examined a Buddhist monk in Taiwan who showed signs of life days after being declared dead. He had brain activity and well-preserved internal organs. Skeptics argue he was not dead, but supporters say this fits with the Buddhist concept of "siddhis" or supernatural powers. 

- In the Hindu yoga tradition, consciousness is considered essential and pervasive in all matter from the beginning of creation. Consciousness has no location and is dimensionless. Modern physics also considers ideas of a conscious universe or that consciousness was part of creation.

- The body expresses creative intelligence through processes like the immune system. From the yoga perspective, the body is inherently a "body of bliss." Examples like the preserved monk's body show consciousness keeps the body intact. 

- Yoga teaches there are koshas or sheaths that the consciousness descends through, from bliss to thought to emotions to the physical body. 

- Realizing one's consciousness is connected to all creation means thoughts and intentions can manifest events through the principle of "shakti" or creative energy/power. With stronger shakti, one can inhabit a body of bliss extending in all directions.

 Here are the key points about why meditation is good for the body according to yoga:

- Meditation puts you in a state of simple awareness. This reduces stress and benefits blood pressure, heart rate, immune response, etc. 

- Every thought has "shakti," or energy that affects the physical world. Meditation calms the mind and reduces stressful thoughts, which reduces the negative energy flow in the body. 

- Meditation helps connect the mind and body as a single whole. It allows you to influence the mind-body system through intention and awareness consciously. This promotes health and well-being. 

- Moving from an outer-focused mindset (Mind 1) to a more meditative inner awareness (Mind 2) changes one's perspective on life from separation to connection. This is healthier for both mind and body. 

- Reaching a state of expanded awareness (Mind 3) through meditation places one in a field of creative intelligence where all experiences emerge. This free and unbounded state is liberating for both physical and mental health. 

So in summary, meditation promotes wellness by reducing stress, connecting the mind-body system, bringing greater self-awareness, and freeing one from limited perspectives - all of which have downstream positive impacts on various physical parameters like blood pressure, immunity, etc. according to yoga philosophy.


- The author began writing the book before the COVID-19 pandemic gripped the world, and finished it after lockdowns lasted longer than anticipated. 

- In troubled times, people often turn to religion and spirituality for solace, though many become less attached to organized religion. The need for spirituality persists beyond crises. 

- Wisdom provides answers about existence and purpose. It gets to the Heart of reality and binds our impulse to feel whole. Mature spirituality begins when listening within. 

- Today's spiritual scene embraces many outside organized faiths who have experienced transcendence when the ego drops away. It represents wisdom as personal experience rather than doctrine. 

- While hope exists, spirituality has not made any inroads politically or socially. However, it deserves consideration without labels as a grassroots movement of personal seeking. Poetry expresses spiritual yearning beautifully. 

- The author is grateful for support during the lockdown writing process, which highlighted the need for meaningful values. Spiritual values sustain purpose in hard times. The future of wisdom lies in listening within to the timeless source of reality.
