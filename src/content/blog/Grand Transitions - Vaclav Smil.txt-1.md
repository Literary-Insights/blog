 Here is a summary of the key points from the introduction:

- The book examines five "grand transitions" that have shaped the modern world: population, agriculture, energy, economies, and the environment. 

- It looks at the origins, enabling factors, progress, interactions and consequences of these transitions over history. 

- The author has conducted extensive previous research on topics related to these transitions like food production, energy resources, economic inputs, and the global environment. 

- Keeping the book to a manageable length while avoiding omissions was a challenge given the broad interdisciplinary scope. 

- The book takes a quantitative approach and focuses on specific demographic, agricultural, energy, economic and environmental data and outcomes. 

- The author is skeptical of predictive global models of these complex interacting systems due to uncertainties and limited understanding. 

- Graphic models of interactions are not used because realistic depictions would be too complex and unable to convey feedbacks, delays and qualitative changes over time. 

- Disentangling the transitions is difficult given uncertain trajectories and outcomes only revealed once processes have largely run their course.

So in summary, the introduction lays out the broad focus on examining the history and interactions of key transitions that shaped the modern world from a quantitative perspective. It acknowledges the challenges of this interdisciplinary scope.

 

- The modern world arose through a series of interconnected transitions, including population dynamics, agriculture/food production, energy resources/conversion, industrialization, trade, wealth distribution, and environmental impacts. 

- Premodern societies (before 1500) saw some changes like advances in metallurgy, arts, conflicts, but were generally inert regarding fundamental existential dynamics like population growth, agriculture, energy sources. 

- In contrast, modern societies underwent rapid transformations in these fundamental areas through concatenated transitions that changed traditional arrangements into modern ones. These transitions were synergistic but also antagonistic, with complex outcomes.

- Understanding the origins, processes, interactions of these epochal transitions provides the best way to explain how the realities of today's world - including declining fertility rates, abundant food, intensive energy use, globalization - emerged from the past. 

- However, modeling these transitions simplistically ignores unexpected developments and feedbacks. The text will take an empirical, nonlinear approach to describing these grand societal shifts.

In summary, the text argues that interconnected transitions across population, agriculture, energy, industry, trade, wealth and environment drove the modernization process in fundamentally disruptive ways compared to premodern inertia.

 

The passage contrasts life in different periods and regions through the lens of mothers and sons. It discusses the immense changes experienced across just one or two generations as a result of major socioeconomic transitions. 

In France, a woman born in the early 19th century lived a subsistence life similar to her ancestors, while her son in 1870s Paris benefited from industrialization and urbanization, enjoying new amenities. In China, a peasant woman born in 1945 survived a devastating famine, while her son born in 1965 came of age during economic reforms and grew extremely wealthy as China modernized rapidly. 

The passage uses these personal stories to vividly illustrate how grand transformations like industrialization, urbanization, and economic development could compress enormous changes into a single lifetime that otherwise may have taken centuries. Traditional inert patterns of life were disrupted, creating unprecedented improvements in living standards and opportunities within short periods of time.

 

- The passage describes a fictional but realistic narrative about a Chinese family that has succeeded across generations, with the grandson now living in Canada. 

- It contrasts this with France's transition over a century. China achieved a similar transition in less than two generations, emerging from greater deprivation during the Great Famine. 

- The key differences were China benefiting from foreign investment and technology transfers worth trillions of dollars.

- The book aims to systematically examine how epochal societal transitions occurred. It will describe premodern norms and growth rates, explore various transition trajectories, and outline outcomes in transformed societies. 

- Before diving into topics, the passage provides brief "before and after" summaries contrasting pre-transition and post-transition states regarding demographics, agriculture/diet, and energy to mark where societies came from and advanced to. It acknowledges simplifications and will later provide nuanced analyses.

 

- Traditional pre-industrial economies relied heavily on human and animal labor (animate power) for tasks like agriculture, food processing, construction, forestry, mining, and commerce. Waterwheels and windmills began supplementing animate power for stationary tasks in some regions. 

- Oared ships remained common for naval warfare and trade through the 16th-18th centuries. Thermal energy came solely from burning biomass like wood and animal dung. Efficiencies were low.

- Early industrialization was led by labor-intensive textiles but required expanded mining and iron/steel production. Construction supported growing urban populations and new infrastructure like canals and railroads. Transportation advanced through steam power, internal combustion, and aviation. 

- Post-WWII, the services sector became dominant. Economic growth accelerated along with population declines. Food/energy became more affordable. International trade expanded in raw materials and finished goods. 

- Population, energy, and economic transitions increased exploitation of resources and caused widespread environmental degradation through deforestation, pollution, and biodiversity loss. This created global environmental problems requiring international cooperation.

 

- Grand societal transitions like demographic, economic, energy and dietary shifts have profoundly shaped the modern world but are highly complex and interdependent processes that cannot be simplified or generalized. 

- These transitions unfolded at different paces in different regions due to varying social, economic, political and environmental factors. Some places experienced early starts while others saw much delayed transitions. 

- Even within developed countries, the timing and pathways of transitions were diverse, sometimes unfolding over generations or converging rapidly within a lifetime due to discontinuities like wars or regime changes. 

- Latecomers sometimes caught up through concurrent, accelerated transitions enabled by adopting foreign technologies. China's post-Mao economic rise is an example. 

- The trajectories and endpoints of transitions were often unpredictable. While some shifts like mechanization were inevitable, nobody could foresee the full impacts of information access like the printing press or internet. 

- Considering the complex interplay of variables involved, sweeping generalizations about what drove or mimicked transitions between societies should be avoided. National peculiarities were always significant influences.

 

- The passage discusses the historical trends of printing, the internet, and technological innovations more broadly. It notes that printing expanded dramatically from the 15th-18th centuries as the number of publications increased by orders of magnitude. 

- Similarly, the early internet in the 1990s saw a proliferation of search engines, but Google eventually dominated the market. 

- Technological transitions typically follow an S-curve pattern, starting slowly, accelerating, then leveling off. Examples given are the displacement of draft horses in the U.S. over 80 years and the transition from ocean liners to jet airplanes for transatlantic travel within a decade.

- Expectations of transformations do not always match realities. Electric cars had an early start but failed to take off initially. Similarly, predictions of nuclear power dominance have not come to pass despite large investments. Transitions involve irregularities and surprises rather than certain outcomes.

So in summary, the passage examines historical case studies of printing, the internet, transportation to illustrate typical S-curve patterns of technological change, while noting expectations do not always align with actual adoption trajectories.

 

- In the late 19th century, electric vehicles were seen as more promising than steam-powered or gasoline vehicles. They were lighter, easier to operate, cleaner, and didn't require dangerous refueling. 

- In 1896, an electric vehicle decisively beat a gasoline vehicle in the first American track race. In 1899, a French electric car became the first road vehicle to reach 100 km/h.

- Commercial electric vehicle production started in the US in 1897. By 1899, over 1,500 electric vehicles were produced annually in the US, surpassing gasoline vehicles. 

- Electric vehicles were marketed as safer, cleaner, easier to drive, and more economical than gasoline vehicles. Some charging infrastructure was established between New York and Philadelphia. 

- However, Edison spent over a decade trying to develop a better battery for electric vehicles but was unsuccessful. Gasoline vehicles ultimately triumphed due to advances in internal combustion engines and fuel availability/infrastructure. 

- Major moves toward electric vehicles did not occur again until the late 20th century, though goals were not met. We are now in the early stages of another transition from gasoline to electric vehicles over a century later.

 

- The demographic transition is the process whereby mortality and fertility rates in a population decline from high to low levels, resulting in changing population growth rates over time. 

- Ronald Lee provides a concise description of the typical stages: high birth/death rates with slow growth pre-transition, declining mortality followed by declining fertility causes accelerated then slowed growth, ending with low birth/death rates and an aging population.

- Graphs can show the simplified trajectory but actual transitions vary between countries. 

- The transition has massive consequences like rapid temporary population growth, aging populations, and urbanization. However, its importance has been underestimated in development theory. 

- Critics argue the idealized model does not replicate all national experiences and question its existence, but ignoring the undeniable shift from high to low fertility/mortality ignores fundamental demographic evidence. 

- Understanding country-specific variances requires knowledge of key demographic variables like birth rates, death rates, and their influences. 

- Urbanization accelerated due to industrialization and emigration from rural areas, playing a major role in transformations to fertility, food demand, energy use, economies, and the environment.

 

- Demographic transitions involve shifts from high fertility and high mortality to low fertility and low mortality as populations undergo economic and social transformations. 

- Traditional societies had maximum fertility rates of around 7-8 children per woman on average, supported by early menarche, late menopause, and a lack of effective birth control. Some African countries still have fertility rates in this range today. 

- While some argue that traditional populations in places like Japan and China had lower fertility due to deliberate birth spacing and limiting, evidence is limited and alternative explanations like malnutrition and disease were also factors in lowering birth rates. 

- Most populations had transitioned somewhat from "reckless procreation" to some parity-specific birth control by the 17th-18th centuries, but dramatic fertility declines generally did not occur until the 19th century in Europe and later elsewhere as mortality also declined through public health improvements. 

- Multiple proximate factors influence fertility, including marriage rates, contraception, breastfeeding, and access to abortion - with marriage rates and contraception being the main drivers of fertility decline through demographic transitions.

 

- In the traditional pre-transition phase, birth rates were largely uncontrolled due to factors like early marriage, ineffective contraception, and lack of conscious fertility control. Mortality rates were high so population growth remained low. 

- The transition began with control of fertility through delayed marriage and celibacy. Parents wanted to provide their children a standard of living equal to their own, so limited family size. 

- Notestein identified three stages: pre-transition with irregular growth; early transition with declining mortality but not fertility, causing rapid growth; late transition with declining fertility and slowing growth. 

- Countries followed varied trajectories, with most European countries starting their decline in the late 19th century. Declines began earliest in France in the 1820s and latest in some countries before WWI. 

- Post-1950 transitions in East Asia were much faster, taking generations in Europe but being completed within lifetimes in some Asian countries like South Korea and China through the one-child policy. Iran also saw a rapid fertility decline.

 

The trend toward larger family size began in the late 1930s in some countries, driven by factors like higher marriage rates and lower marriage ages. Starting in the late 1960s, many European and North American countries entered a "second demographic transition" characterized by later marriage ages, lower marriage rates, and sub-replacement fertility levels below 2.1 children per woman. Average fertilities declined significantly in countries like the US, Japan, and Russia between 1950-2000. Some exceptions were France, which maintained replacement-level fertility, and Scandinavian countries which saw less steep declines. 

Declining mortality played a major role in triggering demographic transitions as it reduced the need for large families. However, cultural values and economic factors also influenced fertility behavior. While mortality decline preceded fertility decline, in some cases fertility rose briefly after initial mortality declines. Wealthier families in countries like Italy tended to adopt birth control earlier. Theories propose both material factors like a "quantity-quality tradeoff" of fewer higher-investment children as well as cultural emancipation as drivers of lower fertility. Africa remains an exception with cultural preferences still favoring moderately high fertility in many societies. Overall most countries are now below replacement-level fertility and this global transition represents a major transformation in human demographic patterns.

 Here is a summary of the key points from the passage:

- Oded Galor attributed fertility decline to rising demand for human capital in the latter half of the 19th century, as incomes rose allowing more education investment in children. This created a self-reinforcing cycle of increasing education and technical progress. 

- Other studies found mortality decline and technical progress were major factors in demographic transitions in Sweden, England, and France, more so than old-age support needs. 

- Rising female labor force participation and reduced gender wage gaps contributed to lower fertility levels over time.

- Caldwell argued demographic shifts reflected changes in intergenerational wealth flows from children to parents with nuclear families.

- Explanations also include diffusion of contraceptive innovations enabled by family planning programs. 

- Cultural shifts like secularization and women's emancipation also played a role by allowing more individual autonomy and choice.

- Demographic transitions led to profound effects like vastly reduced infant/child mortality, temporarily more stable family lives, and higher living standards due to smaller families. 

- Other impacts were improved health, nutrition, education levels, female empowerment, and unprecedented population growth creating temporary rapid increases before slowing again.

 

- Global population growth rates increased steadily from the late 17th century until peaking at around 2.1% in the mid-20th century. Demographers predicted the growth would lead to a "singularity" in 2026 but this did not occur. 

- As more countries underwent demographic transition, their population aging structures changed. In early stages, high youth dependency slowed economic growth. Later, a "demographic dividend" occurred as the youth population grew and worker-to-dependent ratios improved, boosting incomes and savings.

- Countries like East Asian nations greatly benefited from the dividend, which lasted decades. It had less impact in Latin America and has yet to fully impact Africa due to sustained high fertility rates.

- The dividend is temporary but its gains can endure if invested properly. Later, aging populations increase elderly dependency ratios, imposing economic burdens if fertility does not rebound.

- Demographic changes facilitated industrialization and export-led manufacturing economies. Improved health, education and longevity further enhanced economic productivity.  

- Future challenges include aging societies, population decline in some regions, urbanization and migration flows driven by demographic shifts. Sustained low fertility will result in higher elderly dependency and population decreases over the long-run.

 

- Data from five European countries between 1873-1913 showed that public health programs accelerated declines in mortality rates. This was due not just to expanded healthcare, but also the dissemination of health information and hygiene awareness. 

- Studies in England/Wales and the US found that therapies/medicines made little contribution to mortality declines in the 19th-early 20th centuries. Improvements in hygiene and nutrition had a much more significant impact in reducing infant/childhood mortality. 

- Until mid-20th century, less than 20% of longevity gains were for those over 65. Now over 75% of gains are for the elderly as that share is still rising. However, most of humanity has yet to experience this longevity transition. 

- Further gains in maximum life expectancy will likely be limited as aging follows exponential decline patterns. Data from several countries indicate longevity has plateaued just short of 100 years. Gains are slowing and appear to level off at an average of 80 years by 2050.

 

- There are more optimistic assessments that life expectancy may continue to increase slightly, by around 0.15 years per year, for a few more decades based on some studies. However, the effects of telomere extension or calorie restriction on prolonging human life have not been proven yet. 

- Higher longevity will benefit individuals but pose challenges for aging societies with problems of frailty, disability, and caregiving needs outstripping available resources. 

- Japan provides an example as it already has over 27% of its population over 65, projected to rise to over 30% by 2030. The old age dependency ratio is very high and projected to increase significantly. 

- Aging will strain welfare, health, and pension systems. There are also shortages of caregivers. Most people over 100 still have physical or mental impairment. Natural disasters would impact many frail elderly. 

- In addition, Japan's population is now declining due to low fertility. Projections show a falling and aging population, with far more elderly than children in the future. The 2011 earthquake and tsunami displaced many elderly permanently. 

- In summary, while longevity may increase, population aging and decline pose serious challenges for social and economic systems in countries like Japan. High levels of frailty and care needs are a concern.

 Here is a summary of the key points from the IPSSR (2017) passage:

- Japan is facing significant population decline and depopulation over the coming decades, losing up to 45 million people (equal to Spain's population) by 2050. Rural areas and villages have been especially impacted. 

- By 2040, nearly 900 towns and villages will become unviable. Many mountainous and island areas are already experiencing worrisome depopulation. Prefectures like Iwate and Fukushima could see population declines of 30-35% by the 2030s. 

- Unclaimed land area is rising dramatically and expected to increase nearly 4x to 7.2 million hectares by 2040. Vacant houses surpassed 10 million by 2018, including in growing urban areas. 

- Continued depopulation will undermine Japan's economic strength as one of the world's leading manufacturing powers. Its political standing may decline as its population shrinks relative to other nations.

- However, Japan could still be an economic/technical leader even with a smaller population of 90 million in 2060, similar to its size in 1955 during initial economic rise. Immigration could also help offset decline but Japan has shown little willingness so far.

- China faces an even faster transition to an aging society, with those over 65 rising from 10% to over 26% by 2050. This will burden its pension system and be exacerbated by gender imbalance from the one-child policy.

- Aging populations and declines are common now in parts of Europe and affect other Asian nations as well. Immigration helps North America but creates its own challenges.

 

- In the 19th-early 20th centuries, much European migration to the Americas, Africa, Australia went to rural regions to develop new farmland. Chinese migration also moved northeast internally. 

- Post-WWII migration has overwhelmingly been to urban areas, especially largest cities. Between 1800-1900, London grew 6x, Paris 7x, NYC 60x. Urbanization increased in Western Europe by 1900.

- Major migration destinations have shifted westward over time. In 1825 Asia had 6/10 largest cities, by 1900 Europe/US had 9/10. 

- US immigration was split between large coastal cities and rural settlements on the plains. Brazil's migration also included both cities and rural expansion. 

- Since 1950 urban population increased by 2.1 billion, over 1 billion through immigration. Global urbanization reached 50% by 2008. 

- China underwent the largest urbanization surge ever through internal migration from rural to coastal cities. Its urban population rose from 19% in 1980 to 57% by 2016. 

- China still has 220 million migrants living in cities without full urban residency rights due to its hukou system, though reforms are underway.

 

Urbanization has led to profound social changes by dismantling extended families and creating smaller family units. It has also transferred many personal interactions from family to outsiders like caretakers. Cities offer both reduced and expanded interactions as well as greater isolation and mass participation. Mobility has increased drastically from walking distances to long commutes and frequent travel. 

Economically, cities drive modern industrialization and innovation. They generate a disproportionate share of economic output and wealth due to agglomeration effects like reducing transportation costs and facilitating expertise sharing. Continuing urbanization is making megacities more dominant economically. 

Historically, 19th century industrial cities had major environmental and living standard issues like overcrowding, pollution, long work hours and child labor. However, they did improve living standards by providing stable access to food preventing famine. Public health and education standards also increased over time. Environmental quality improved with innovations like gas lighting and electric lights, as well as demolishing old quarters and improving infrastructure.

In summary, urbanization has led to profound social changes while cities have become increasingly dominant economically. However, living standards increased gradually over time through improvements to infrastructure, public health, education and the environment, even as inequality issues persist.

 

- Megacities are defined as cities with over 10 million people. There were 2 megacities in 1950 (New York and Tokyo) and 31 in 2016, with 18 in Asia. Tokyo is currently the largest at nearly 39 million people. 

- Megacities face greater challenges due to their immense scale, including issues with housing, transportation, infrastructure demands, pollution, heat islands, habitat destruction, and extreme population densities exceeding 50,000 people/km2. 

- Natural disasters and emergencies would have widespread global impacts in megacities due to their critical roles in the global economy and mass air travel. Climate change issues like heat waves also threaten megacities.

- Moving from villages to megacities is associated with doubling or tripling per capita resource demands on food, water, materials and energy to power urban infrastructure, transportation, appliances, and more intensive lifestyles. 

- Despite challenges, megacities continue growing rapidly, with the world's first 50 million-person city expected in the not-too-distant future. Urbanization advocates claim megacities become more efficient and sustainable at large scales, but they ignore the massive resource demands of urban living.

 

- Over the past century, agricultural productivity has increased dramatically due to a combination of crop breeding, agronomic advances, mechanization, synthetic fertilizers, agrochemicals, and other technological improvements. 

- Crop yields have multiplied or increased by an order of magnitude compared to traditional yields. Labor productivity in wheat production, for example, increased 18-fold from 1800-1900 and quadrupled from 1900-2000 due to mechanization. 

- Economies of scale led to fewer but larger specialized farms. While farms once produced multiple crops, by 2000 most focused on one crop. Fewer farms also had livestock. 

- Productivity gains made most agricultural labor redundant, allowing migration to cities. Even as the farm population declined, food availability per capita increased. 

- Modern farming depends critically on fossil fuel and electricity inputs to power machinery, produce inputs like fertilizers, and support activities like research. This external energy subsidy enhances natural photosynthesis. 

- Dietary and consumption patterns underwent a transition, including decreased grain/legume intake and increased consumption of animal products and sugars in many countries. 

- These shifts brought expansion of affordability, variety, and internationalization of diets but also new nutrition and environmental concerns.

 

- Modern farming relies heavily on energy subsidies in the form of fossil fuels. Direct and indirect energy inputs into American wheat cultivation range from 3.1-4.9 GJ/ton on average. 

- Producing the wheat for a single loaf of bread requires around 2.8 MJ of energy inputs like diesel fuel. Eating store-bought bread would require double this amount due to processing and distribution.

- Energy subsidies to agriculture have increased dramatically over time, from less than 1 GJ/ha in the 19th century to 10-100 GJ/ha in recent decades as examples from France, Canada, and Spain show. 

- Meat production, especially poultry and pork, relies on energy-intensive animal feed production. Raising a chicken requires around 8.7 MJ of feed, equivalent to nearly a cup of diesel fuel. 

- Global food and feed trade also relies on energy-intensive shipping. Transportation can account for a significant portion of the energy inputs, for example over 30% for soybeans shipped from Brazil. 

- Total annual energy inputs to global food production, including trade, are estimated at around 15-20 exajoules, accounting for around 4% of global primary energy use. Aquaculture and seafood production also require substantial energy.

- Reliance on these energy subsidies is necessary to support the world's current population of over 7.5 billion people, but represents a vulnerability due to disproportionate effects of small inputs in complex systems.

 

- The deployment of the automatic cream separator in the late 19th century helped increase dairy production efficiency. 

- Three concurrent agricultural advances around the same time were the Haber-Bosch process for synthesizing ammonia, the gradual elimination of animal draft power in farming, and the development of better crop varieties.

- The Haber-Bosch process, commercialized in 1913, enabled mass production of nitrogen fertilizer which was crucial for increasing crop yields to feed growing populations. It led to wheat production that could feed up to 45% of today's population. 

- Eliminating draft animals like horses freed up land for food/feed crops and allowed mechanization with tractors. Improved machinery like combines further boosted productivity.

- New hybrid corn varieties in the early 20th century doubled and then quadrupled yields. Genetically modified crops in the late 20th century led to additional yield gains, particularly for corn. Wheat yield increases came from developing shorter varieties with higher harvest indices.

- Together, these advances in agrochemicals, machinery, and crop genetics were pivotal in modernizing agriculture and increasing global food supplies.

 

- Traditional wheat and rice cultivars had low grain to straw ratios, meaning they yielded similar amounts of grain and straw. Modern short-stalked varieties have much higher harvest indexes, yielding more grain than straw.

- Two wheat varieties released in 1962 helped launch the "Green Revolution" with a high harvest index of 0.5. Global wheat yields have since increased significantly, averaging over 3 tons/hectare globally and over 5 tons in China. 

- Short-stalked rice varieties also improved yields greatly, with the first high-yielding variety in 1966 having a harvest index of 0.6. Rice yields have also increased substantially globally and in countries like Japan and China.

- To further increase yields, seeding rates have increased significantly. For example, US corn plantings now use 78,000 seeds/hectare compared to 37,000-45,000 traditionally. Higher yields and inputs have allowed crop production to shift from food to animal feed.

- Animal feeding has transitioned from small mixed farms to large centralized operations. Numbers of animals have increased greatly while feeding times have decreased and weights increased. Majority of global crop production is now for animal feed rather than direct human consumption.

 

- Beef is the least efficient meat to produce, requiring at least 25 times as much feed as the amount of edible meat. Pork requires about 9 times as much feed as edible meat. 

- Pigs are inherently more efficient than other mammals, requiring about 40% less feed relative to their body mass. However, breeding for leanness has reduced some of these gains. Converting feed to fat is more efficient than converting to lean meat.

- Broiler production has seen the biggest efficiency gains, going from over 5 units of feed per unit of live weight in the 1930s to 1.6-1.8 units today. This has driven down costs and increased consumption. 

- Egg and milk production efficiencies have improved only marginally. Mutton/lamb efficiencies have not improved at all. 

- Most aquacultured seafood requires around 3 units of feed per unit of edible meat, comparable to chicken. Salmon is more efficient at 1.8 units while tilapia and prawns are less at over 4 units.

So in summary, broiler production has seen the greatest long-term efficiency gains, while beef remains inherently the least efficient meat to produce on a feed conversion basis. Pigs are more efficient than ruminants but breeding has reduced some gains from improved feeding.

 

- Reports of food consumption from surveys are estimates based on what people remember and report eating, not completely accurate records. 

- Food waste has historically occurred pre-harvest due to pests and diseases, and post-harvest due to lack of storage and transportation facilities. Modern agriculture and infrastructure have reduced but not eliminated waste. 

- Globally, consumption of staple grains and legumes has significantly declined as diets have diversified with increasing income. Staples once provided most daily calories but now account for less than a third in many places. 

- Meat consumption has risen dramatically worldwide over the past century as incomes rose and meat became more affordable and accessible. Traditional diets included very little meat consumed only occasionally by most people. Industrialization enabled mass meat production and consumption. 

- Milk consumption has also grown substantially in many countries where it was not traditionally part of diets, such as Japan which now consumes more dairy than rice annually per capita.

 

- Meat consumption increased dramatically in Mediterranean countries like Greece, Spain and Portugal from the low intake levels of less than 20 kg/year in the 1950s. Intake grew significantly after these countries joined the EU in the 1980s. Spanish meat supply quintupled from 1960-2000 to 112 kg/capita, surpassing Germany, France and Netherlands. 

- The US has long been a leading meat consuming nation due to grazing lands and animal feed supply. Intake averaged 75 kg/capita in 1910 and peaked at 90 kg/capita in 1971 before declining to around 95 kg/capita currently, with rising poultry partially offsetting a cut in red meat. 

- Meat consumption patterns vary widely today. French data from 2013 shows 37% were low consumers eating 80 g/day versus 28% high consumers eating 217 g/day. Japanese intake rose from under 5 kg/capita in 1960s to 30 kg/capita in 2010 before declining over 10%. Chinese intake has rapidly grown from barely adequate diets to 61.8 kg/capita currently.

- In many wealthy countries, intake has saturated or declined from past peaks due to health concerns. There has been a shift from red meat to poultry consumption globally. Brazil is an exception with meat supply tripling since 1975 to near 100 kg/year currently. Consumption remains low in Southeast/South Asia below 15 kg/capita. 

- Milk consumption patterns have also changed significantly around the world in recent decades. US intake peaked at 171 kg/capita after WWII before declining over 40% to around 80 kg/capita currently. European countries have also seen stagnation or declines from past peaks. Japan and China have greatly increased dairy intake despite large lactose intolerant populations historically by consuming products with reduced lactose like fermented drinks and cheeses.

 

- Sugar originated as a medicine and was brought to Europe by Muslim invasions, but remained expensive throughout the Middle Ages. It became more commonly used in cooking and cuisine by the Renaissance. 

- Colonial powers setting up sugar plantations in the Americas and Caribbean increased imports to Europe in the late 18th century. Britain led consumption which rose from under 2 kg/person annually in 1700 to over 40 kg/person by 1900. 

- US sugar consumption rose from 30 kg/person in 1875 to over 69 kg/person by 2000, then declined to 58 kg/person by 2015. Composition changed with high-fructose corn syrup providing 45% of sweeteners by 2015, versus 90% from refined sugar in 1900.

- In contrast, sugar intake remains relatively low in East Asia like China and Japan, which consume under 17 kg/person annually. Traditional diets there used sugar sparingly. 

- Fat intake has universally increased with economic development. China traditionally had very low cooking oil availability until recent decades.

- Fruit and vegetable consumption has more than doubled globally since 1960, benefitting from year-round availability in colder climates. Intake is higher in newly industrialized countries.

- Nutritional understanding advanced in the late 19th/early 20th centuries regarding protein, vitamin, and mineral needs. Intakes have generally met or exceeded requirements in most populations.

- Some key shifts include increased lipid intake outpacing recommendations, and a shift from animal to plant fats especially in the US and Europe. Vitamin and mineral levels also rose overall.

 

- Dairy, meat and sodium intake have significantly increased due to agricultural and nutritional transitions. Fiber intake has remained largely unchanged. 

- Eliminating famines and reducing undernutrition are major achievements of nutritional transition. All populations now benefit from unprecedented food availability and affordability. 

- Micronutrient deficiencies still persist in some groups, even in affluent nations. Undernutrition in low-income countries is often due to uneven access and poor care, not inadequate supply. 

- Rising consumption of animal foods has contributed to significant height increases globally as malnutrition has been reduced. Height is a sensitive indicator of food supply changes.

- Agricultural transition made food more affordable as shares of income spent on food declined steadily over time according to Engel's law. At the same time, total spending and variety of foods available increased in wealthy nations and households.

 

- Historically, the share of income spent on food has declined significantly in many countries over the last century. In the US, it was about 43% in the early 20th century, 20% by 1950, and below 10% since 2000. Other developed nations have seen similar declines to 10-15%. 

- There has been a transition to more money being spent eating out rather than at home. In the US, money spent eating out was below 10% in 1900, 20% by 1950, and about 40% by 2015. Meal delivery services have also grown.

- Food diversity has increased significantly. Diets were previously more limited and based on local staples, but now include many global cuisines. 

- Food waste is a major issue, with estimates of 30-40% of food being wasted in developed nations. This amounts to over 1,400 calories per person per day wasted in the US. High food waste exacerbates environmental and resource use issues. 

- Despite significant food waste, overconsumption of calories and unhealthy diets have led to rising obesity rates, now approaching 40% of the US population. This is driven more by choices around eating and activity levels rather than just increased food availability.

 

- Almost 75% of American adults are now considered overweight or obese based on BMI measures. Overweight and obesity rates among children and teenagers are also over 50%. Lower-income groups have even higher rates. 

- The US still leads in obesity rates, but many other countries now have overweight/obesity rates over 60% for men and 50% for women, including Australia, Mexico, UK, Germany, Czech Republic, and Portugal. Worldwide obesity rates have risen sharply over the past few decades.

- Unhealthy diets high in sugar and processed foods are major contributors to rising rates of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. However, the links between diet and these health conditions are complex and not fully understood. 

- In the mid-20th century, studies linked saturated fat intake to heart disease, leading to widespread recommendations of low-fat diets. However, more recent reviews find little evidence that saturated fat intake directly causes heart disease or that limiting it provides clear health benefits. 

- Sugar consumption has risen sharply and is strongly associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Lifestyle interventions focusing on reducing sugar/energy intake and increasing activity can significantly lower diabetes rates. However, few Americans follow the diets and behaviors known to reduce diabetes risk.

 

- The total land area used for agriculture has expanded dramatically since 1700, growing from around 260 million ha in 1700 to 1.5 billion ha in 2000. 

- The first major expansion occurred in the late 19th century as grasslands were converted, mainly in North America, Argentina, and Russia. 

- The second major expansion took place after 1950, led by tropical deforestation in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. 

- Land used for pastures has expanded even faster than cropland, growing sevenfold since 1700 to around 3.2 billion ha currently. 

- The total land devoted to croplands and pastures is now over 4.8 billion ha, nearly 40% of ice-free land on Earth. 

- Even issues that affect small fractions of farmland have had extensive impacts due to the vast scale of agriculture. For example, monocultures and soil erosion problems now occur over large areas.

- Other issues discussed include soil contamination from heavy metals, plastic pollution from thin films used on fields, water contamination leading to dead zones, and greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture and food transportation.

 

- Before the Industrial Revolution, nearly all energy came from biomass fuels like wood, charcoal, and crop residues burned inefficiently in open fires. This produced high pollution indoors. 

- England started shifting from wood to coal in the 16th century. Other European nations and the US followed 200-250 years later. Some areas relied more on hydro or peat first before transitioning to coal and later oil/gas.

- Transitioning from wood to coal was necessary to power industrialization. Wood alone could not have supported iron production or other energy-intensive industries. 

- Coal extraction in the UK accelerated in the 1600s and coal supplied over half the energy by 1620 and over 90% by 1800. Other countries made the transition later - France wasn't below 50% wood until the 1870s and Sweden until the 1900s. 

- The shift to fossil fuels allowed the transition from proto-industrialization to full industrialization by providing a more energy-dense fuel than wood alone could support. This was a major enabling factor for rapid economic and social changes in the Industrial Revolution.

 

b) If the world relied on charcoal to produce the 1.25 Gt of pig iron in 2018, it would require around 3 Gt of wood or 4.7 billion m3 of wood. In comparison, global industrial roundwood harvest in 2016 was only 1.8 billion m3, which is less than 40% of what would be needed for iron smelting alone. Growing that amount of wood in tropical plantations would easily require an area greater than half the size of the Amazon Basin. Therefore, modern ferrous metallurgy relying on charcoal would have to be significantly restricted in output. 

Coal initially saw major growth driven by industries, households, and powering steam engines. But cheaper fossil fuels like oil eventually displaced coal for these uses. In the UK, coal output peaked in 1913 but then declined rapidly, shutting down completely by 2015. Coal extraction also ended in the Netherlands in 1974 and France in 2004. In contrast, use of biomass (wood/waste) has never been eliminated in major economies, still providing around 2% of energy in countries like the US and EU.

 Here is a summary of the key points about long-lasting pipelines from the passage:

- The transition from coal to natural gas and petroleum products like gasoline created more efficient, convenient and lower pollution energy systems. Natural gas distribution through pipelines is much more efficient and easy to use than delivering and burning coal.

- Coal-fired locomotives and steamships enabled rapid expansion of rail and shipping routes globally in the 19th century, connecting economies and enabling mass migration. They were later replaced by more powerful diesel engines. 

- Adoption of diesel engines displaced solid fuels like coal from waterborne transportation. This facilitated unprecedented global economic integration in the 20th century. 

- Kerosene was an important early oil product but gasoline usage grew rapidly with the rise of automobile ownership in the early 20th century, led by models like the Ford Model T. This drove expansion of gasoline refining and distribution infrastructure like pipelines.

- Long-lasting transportation infrastructure transitions like dieselization of rail/shipping and rise of road vehicles relied on building out pipelines and distribution networks for liquid fuels to enable their widespread adoption. These facilitated global connectivity and economic changes.

 

- In the late 19th century, horse teams produced 1-1.5 kW of power and large teams pulling grain combines had 8-20 kW. A good horse was equal to 7 men, while an ox replaced 2.5 men. 

- By deploying draft animals, 19th century French farming multiplied labor potential 5 times, while British farming multiplied it 12 times due to larger, better fed animals. American farming in 1920, with 21 million working horses/mules, multiplied labor potential over 15 times.

- Tractors were introduced in the late 1880s but only 3.6% of farms had tractors by 1920, while 90% still used horses. Mechanization accelerated in the 1930s as tractors matched animal power. By 1950 tractors accounted for 88% of power and the transition finished by 1960 with machines providing 65 GW vs animals' 14.5 GW in 1910. 

- Electric streetcars, not cars, initially replaced urban horses in the late 19th century. Most horses pulled omnibuses and streetcars. Trucks later replaced remaining cart horses in cities.

- Gasoline engines revolutionized transportation starting in the 1890s but the Model T made cars widely affordable from 1908-1927. Diesel engines powered trucks from the 1920s on. Jet engines enabled faster planes from the 1940s. Gas turbines generate most electricity and power aviation today.

 

- In the early 20th century in the US, steam engines and turbines accounted for 60% of mechanical power, draft animals over a third, waterwheels and windmills less than 4%, and internal combustion engines less than 2%. 

- By 1929, due to the rise of automobiles, internal combustion engines took over with 88% of power, steam turbines had 10%, and animal power dropped to 1%.

- Globally in 1850, draft animals provided nearly half of all useful kinetic energy, human muscles about two-fifths, and waterwheels/windmills plus new steam engines the remaining 10-15%. 

- By 1900, inanimate prime movers like steam engines claimed over half of total power, while draft animals fell to a third and human muscles to 20%. 

- By 1950, human and animal labor was dwarfed by fuel-powered machinery dominated by internal combustion engines in vehicles and steam/water turbines. Animate power contributed less than 5% of total.

- By 2000, animate power share fell to only about 5% as internal combustion engines, especially in cars, became dominant due to mass ownership. 

- The transition brought fundamental changes like moving from recent plant fuels to fossil fuels that are more energy dense and portable. It increased fuel power density measured per unit land area.

 

- Wood and charcoal have very low power densities as fuels, around 1 W/m2. Converting wood to charcoal further reduces this density, but charcoal has nearly twice the energy density of air-dry wood. 

- Running a modern civilization solely on biomass would require huge areas of land devoted to growing tree plantations to meet the fuel demands, due to the low power densities. 

- In contrast, fossil fuels have much higher power densities when extracted - at least 101 W/m2 for coal mines and oil/gas fields, and commonly 102-103 W/m2. The most productive fields can exceed 103 W/m2. 

- This means fossil fuel energy production can be highly concentrated into relatively small areas. Giant oil and gas fields in particular produce enormous volumes of fuel from very concentrated areas, which is then transported via pipelines and tankers. 

- While fossil fuels are finite, some giant fields have been producing large amounts of fuel for decades or even over a century at declining rates. Renewable sources will eventually need to replace fossil fuels, but currently have much lower power densities.

 

- Traditionally, lighting methods like candles and oil lamps did not change much for millennia until the 19th century. Gas lighting was introduced in major cities starting in 1812, providing an improved option. 

- Electric lighting emerged as a revolutionary change starting in the 1880s. Rural electrification in the US progressed slowly, reaching only 1.6% of farms by 1920. The Rural Electrification Administration, formed in 1936, accelerated electrification through loans and cooperatives. 

- Complete electrification of the US took around 75 years, from 1882 to 1956. Other countries electrified faster, while many parts of the developing world still have low electrification rates today. 

- Incandescent light bulbs dominated electricity use for over 75 years but were inefficient. Fluorescent then compact fluorescent lights replaced them starting in the 1930s-1990s. Halogen and LED lights now dominate due to higher efficiency.

- Electric motors industrialized production by replacing steam-powered drive belts from the 1890s-1920s. This doubled US manufacturing productivity and flexibility. Motors now power over 80% of industry globally.

So in summary, electric lighting and motors fundamentally transformed industries, infrastructure, and daily life over the late 19th-mid 20th centuries, though electrification is still ongoing in many parts of the world.

 

- In the early 20th century, some wealthier households began purchasing small electric gadgets like ceiling fans, lightweight irons, and early toaster models. 

- Major electric appliance adoption proceeded at different rates depending on factors like technical maturity, cost of the product and electricity, living conditions, and lifestyles. Introducing a new product and widespread adoption could take decades. 

- Ranges were the first kitchen appliance to go electric in the US, with 20% of households owning one by 1920 and over 90% by 1955. Washers started diffusing in the mid-1920s but ownership fell during WWII and took until 1964 to reach 50% adoption. 

- Refrigerator adoption grew steadily in the US, reaching 50% in the early 1940s and 90% by 1953, with over 90% ownership today. Air conditioning sales took off after 1960 in the US and by 1974 half of households had it.

- Increasing efficiencies of energy conversions have significantly reduced energy intensities over time despite growing markets. Key fuel use shifts include indirect consumption via electricity and rising transportation fuel use. Fossil fuel use multiplied substantially in the 20th century and continued growing in the early 21st century.

 

- Efficiencies of energy use have significantly improved over time due to gradual improvements in existing conversion methods and adoption of new innovative solutions. Early steam engines had efficiencies under 2% but are now over 40% for steam turbines and over 50% for diesel engines. Indoor heating has seen similar gains. 

- Quantifying the global gains in efficiency is difficult but estimates show the average efficiency of global energy use rose from under 20% in 1900 to around 35% in 1950 and 50% currently, meaning useful energy output has increased over 40x from a 16x rise in primary energy consumption over the 20th century. 

- Three main transitions have reduced energy intensities: new energy sources used more efficiently, new industrial processes requiring less energy, and optimized macro-level energy use through trade and other arrangements. Examples given include more efficient ammonia and steel production.

- While some minimum energy requirements are physical limits, further reductions are still possible through redesign even if not cost effective. Intensities have converged significantly across countries over time from initial three-fold differences.

 

- The passage discusses economic contrasts between pre-transition societies and modern affluent economies. 

- Early economic growth rates during antiquity through 1700 remained quite low, fractions of a percent. Traditional economies had subsistence food production and artisanal work as the main structures. Abundance was only for small elites.

- Examples of more material affluence emerging were 17th century Holland and Edo-era Japan. But rising growth, profound structural shifts, and mass consumption arrived later through demographic, dietary, energy, and technical changes. 

- Unlike other transitions, there are no defined end points for economic transition as affluent societies constantly seek the highest growth. However, structural changes like shifts from agriculture to other sectors can be clearly defined. 

- The passage examines differences in speed and extension of benefits between economic transitions in various countries. Post-1990 literature is further discussed in analyzing national idiosyncrasies of economic transition components.

 Here is a summary of the key points about studies of economic transitions from traditional to modern market-based economies:

- Economic transitions typically refer to transitions from centrally planned Communist economies to more free market economies, as happened in post-Soviet countries in the 1990s. These are termed "second-order" transitions. 

- First-order transitions refer to the historical process of transitioning from traditional societies with low growth, stagnant structures, and limited consumption, to modern industrialized economies focused on growth, structural transformation, and mass consumption. 

- China presents a hybrid case, combining elements of both first and second-order economic transitions in its recent transformation. 

- The sources of accelerated economic growth in first-order transitions included rising energy use from inexpensive fossil fuels, which was a more important driver of growth than traditionally recognized. 

- Britain was the first modern economy to experience sustained growth, averaging around 1% annually in the early 1800s, compared to well under 1% growth rates in previous centuries globally. 

- Factors contributing to Britain's growth include rising total factor productivity, declining dependence on agriculture as productivity rose, and relatively high wage rates and fuel costs that incentivized inventions and efficiency compared to Europe. However, the transition was gradual rather than a single rapid revolution.

 

- Britain was the first country to industrialize in the late 18th/early 19th century due to high wages but cheap coal and capital, which allowed high fixed costs for innovations like steam engines and coke-based iron production. 

- However, culture/Enlightenment ideas were also important factors in Britain's lead, according to historians like Mokyr. Concentration of economic activity, limited government intervention, and new energy supplies also played roles. 

- Other countries like Germany, Belgium, and the U.S. surpassed Britain's growth rates in the 19th century as they industrialized. By the late 19th century, many Western European and Asian countries like Japan were growing faster than Britain. 

- Growth fluctuated in the 20th century due to wars and economic crises but picked up globally in the postwar period until the 1970s oil crisis. Countries emphasized different factors like capital, labor, or productivity.  

- Asian economies like Japan, Taiwan, South Korea industrialized rapidly in the postwar period by focusing on specific industries. China's growth accelerated after economic reforms in the 1980s, making it the largest developing economy. Overall trajectories depended on each country's history, politics, and adoption of foreign models.

 

- The passage discusses GDP per capita figures from 1870-2015 for major countries according to purchasing power parity (PPP) values from the World Bank database. 

- It notes the divergence in economic growth trajectories over this period, with countries like China growing much faster than India or African nations. 

- Technical innovation and capital intensity are identified as factors driving higher productivity and growth in wealthy countries since the 19th century. 

- Data on capital-labor ratios show wealthy countries establishing production functions that define growth possibilities for poorer nations today. 

- China has grown rapidly since 1990 along this trajectory, but replicating this is unlikely for other large populous countries in coming decades. 

- Growth rates are declining globally as major economies like the US and China reach logistic curve inflection points, indicating mature economies are entering an era of lower GDP growth. 

- There is uncertainty around whether mature economies can sustain substantial growth indefinitely or will transition to stationary or even declining economies to address environmental challenges.

 

The passage discusses debates around future economic growth trajectories globally. While some argue that high growth rates cannot continue indefinitely due to factors like environmental limits, others note growth is still occurring rapidly in many developing economies. 

It acknowledges there is uncertainty around forecasting decades into the future. Plausible scenarios range from continuation of recent growth to various forms of slowed, fluctuating, declining or collapsing growth. One new consideration is how economies may respond to climate change threats.

The structure of traditional economies centered around subsistence agriculture employing most workers and output. Modernization pathways included shifting to manufacturing, resource extraction, then services as agriculture declined. Labor was absorbed in expanding secondary and tertiary sectors. 

Definitions of the three broad economic sectors - primary (agriculture/extraction), secondary (manufacturing/construction) and tertiary (services) - are outlined. However, these obscure changes over time as sectors contain heterogeneous activities that may move in opposing directions with development.

 

- The passage discusses models of sectoral economic transitions proposed by Colin Clark and Jean Fourastié in the 1940s and 1949 respectively. They proposed nations gradually transition from primary (agriculture), to secondary (manufacturing), to tertiary (services) economic sectors as they develop. 

- Fourastié proposed specific percentages of employment in each sector for traditional, transitional, and modern economies. However, data from countries like the US and China showed their actual transitions differed significantly from the models. 

- Industrialization was enabled by a labor push from agriculture and labor pull from new industrial jobs. In early stages, the labor pull was more important, but later the labor push as farming modernized. Nation-specific factors also influenced transitions. 

- Industrialization saw shifts from textiles/metals to consumer goods to electronics. Production techniques evolved from artisanal to workshops to factories to complex global supply chains. Aircraft production is used to illustrate these ongoing changes in industrial composition and methods over time.

 

The passage discusses the transformative trajectories of manufacturing industries like motor vehicles and electronics. In both cases, production has moved from small, artisanal workshops to highly automated mass production factories. 

For motor vehicles, output has grown from artisanal vehicles made by bicycle mechanics to nearly 100 million units produced globally each year in modern factories. For electronics, the advances have been even more profound, transforming from bulky vacuum tubes to ubiquitous tiny solid-state devices. 

Industrialization has been both a qualitative and quantitative process. Quantitatively, mass production has driven economies of scale, making products more affordable. Qualitatively, items have improved in functionality, durability and reliability through continuous innovation. 

The passage then examines sectoral economic transitions in major countries. It outlines how countries like England, the US and UK underwent a retreat of agriculture and rise of manufacturing and services. For example, England became predominantly non-agricultural before 1700, and the US farming labor force shrank from 83% in 1800 to just 1.9% by 2000. 

Manufacturing played a key role in creating high-income economies after 1850, due to factors like innovation, job generation and exports. However, many countries have seen manufacturing job losses since the 1980s, raising economic concerns. The UK in particular experienced a rapid deindustrialization and manufacturing decline.

 

Manufacturing has declined significantly as a share of GDP and employment in many developed economies over the past several decades. Examples given are the UK, US, Canada, and countries in Western Europe where manufacturing now accounts for less than 20% of GDP on average. 

The US is highlighted as having lost around 7 million manufacturing jobs (a 35% decline) since 1979. This loss has disproportionately impacted certain Midwestern states. However, total manufacturing production in the US has continued to grow until recently due to rising productivity. 

While manufacturing is declining as traditionally defined by standard sector classifications, the boundaries are not clear cut. Modern manufacturing relies heavily on services like R&D, logistics, management, which are not always counted as part of the sector. Similar issues arise in defining agriculture - modern farming depends on many external inputs from seed companies, machinery producers, suppliers of fuels and chemicals. 

The transitions from agrarian to manufacturing-dominated economies has occurred across both Western countries starting in the late 19th century and more recently in Asian countries like Japan, South Korea and China. However, determining the true scale of changes requires reexamining how modern industries are defined and accounted for.

 

- In India, there are still about twice as many people employed in primary (agriculture and fishing) and secondary (manufacturing) activities compared to tertiary (services) activities. Employment shifts to services only started occurring in 2014. 

- Many developing countries experienced "premature deindustrialization" where manufacturing growth stalled in the 1970s-1980s and the labor force shifted mainly to services like retail and distribution when growth rebounded in the 1990s. 

- This was not due to changes in manufacturing's potential, but because manufacturing rapidly shifted to a small number of countries like China, South Korea, Vietnam and others. As a result, global manufacturing employment did not actually fall between 1970-2010 - it increased in lower productivity economies even as advanced economies saw declines.

- Significant employment shifts from agriculture and manufacturing to services have occurred over the past century and a half in most modern societies as productivity increased in primary and secondary sectors. However, there was often a long gap, sometimes over 100 years, between when this shift occurred for women versus men.

- Within the broad service sector, some notable trends include rapid growth in health/social assistance employment, more modest increases in government employment, and declining employment in transportation/utilities despite population growth, due to changes like private automobile ownership.

 

- The passage discusses how economies have transitioned from agriculture/manufacturing to services over time. It provides examples from various countries. 

- In places like the US and Europe, the share of employment in trade (retail/wholesale) has decreased while financial services have more than doubled their share of employment. Education employment has also risen significantly. 

- International comparisons show variability, e.g. China still has a high percentage in construction due to urbanization, while its healthcare sector lags the US/Japan. 

- World Bank data shows services employment ranging from 7-84% across countries, with developed economies over 70% and China still transitioning at 56%. 

- The shift to services has had complex effects on inequality, unemployment, and income. While it expanded opportunities for women, many low-paying service jobs contributed to rising inequality in places like the US and UK. 

- New areas like online commerce and advanced manufacturing are blurring traditional sector boundaries, requiring rethinking of economic categories. The passage argues modern production is fusing previously separate sectors.

 This passage discusses the transition from traditional societies to modern consumer societies in terms of material consumption and access to information. Some key points:

- Ancient trade-based societies like the Phoenicians maintained extensive info networks to facilitate trade and exploration. Contrasts widened in the early modern era as urban elites had wider info horizons from trade and books. 

- However, rural peasants' lives remained materially deprived and illiterate, so they lacked access to rising info flows. 

- Modern mass consumption is traced through indicators like increased resource/material flows and mobility. Per capita resource consumption rose orders of magnitude, from 5-7 t/year traditionally to 50-85 t/year today. 

- Domestic water use rose fourfold on average, from ~30 L/day traditionally to ~120 L/day today. Freshwater withdrawals rose orders of magnitude, from 15-20 m3/capita traditionally to 200-500 m3/capita in developed nations.

- Housing sizes increased drastically, from traditionally ~50 m2/household or less than 10 m2/capita, to much larger homes in developed nations today. 

So in summary, it tracks the transition to more affluent consumer societies through rising material flows, resource/water usage, mobility, info access, and living standards like larger homes. Traditional societies showed much lower consumption across these indicators.

 

- In 1900, the average house size was no more than 90 square meters. Even in wealthy countries, major increases in living space did not occur until after World War II, with current averages ranging from about 250 square meters for new US homes to 100 square meters for Japanese apartments. 

- While house sizes have increased, qualitative improvements in housing have also greatly enhanced living standards. Features like running water, indoor plumbing, central heating, and appliances are now standard worldwide. However, these amenities became widespread at different times in different places.

- Early stages of consumer societies focused on acquiring basic necessities like beds, furniture, and multi-piece outfits. Middle stages brought smaller comforts like stoves and appliances. Eventually, former luxuries became widely accessible while new, expensive prestige purchases emerged among the wealthy. 

- The transition to consumer societies was gradual and unequal. In early 20th century France, typical families spent 80% of income on food with little left for goods. Urban conditions remained poor for many through the 19th century. Real improvements accelerated in Western nations after World War II.

- Key drivers of higher consumption included declining family size, rising female employment, and growing incomes/spending. Food/housing shares of incomes fell while other purchases rose. Credit also became more available, increasing household debt levels. 

- Mobility increased through public transport like railways and private vehicles. Maximum travel distances commonly rose from a few kilometers locally to occasional longer trips. Technological advances like trains and then cars drove broader mobility gains.

 

- In the early 19th century, the maximum typical daily travel distance was around 100 km for most people, using horse-drawn transportation. Railways in the 1800s increased this to over 100 km. 

- Steam-powered shipping in the 1830s offered scheduled intercontinental routes over 10,000 km, like London to Sydney, taking over a month to complete.

- Commercial air travel began in the 1920s with short routes under 400 km. Advances in aircraft like the DC-3 in the 1930s allowed ranges over 2,000 km. 

- Jet airliners in the 1950s and wide-body aircraft in the 1960s enabled mass long-distance and intercontinental flying. Global airline passengers grew from 310 million in 1970 to over 4 billion by 2019.

- Modern mobility has increased distances traveled by orders of magnitude since the 1830s. Commuting and tourism now involve routine trips over 1,000 km thanks to advances in transportation. 

- International tourist arrivals grew from 69 million in 1960 to over 1.4 billion in 2018, driven by higher incomes, car ownership, and cheaper flights. Popular destinations receive tens or hundreds of millions of visitors annually.

So in summary, transportation innovations over the last 200 years have exponentially expanded the typical distances traveled daily, allowing global mass mobility and tourism on a scale unimaginable in the early 19th century.

 

- International tourism has grown exponentially since 1950 and is predicted to continue rising, with over 4 billion international travelers projected by 2050. However, travel from some countries like France, South Korea and Australia appears saturated, while American departures are still increasing. 

- Mass tourism has already damaged many destinations, leading to visitor limits and calls for restrictions in places like the Galapagos Islands, Cinque Terre, and Banff National Park. Impacts include overdevelopment of landscapes for ski runs and impacts from large cruise ships. 

- The transition to mass-scale international tourism is emblematic of globalized modernity, but its impacts like environmental deterioration are yielding many negative outcomes that must be weighed against economic benefits. 

- Information and communication have been prime drivers of modernization. New technologies like printing, broadcasting, computers and the internet have enabled unprecedented growth in available information and global communication flows. 

- While bringing benefits, this has also resulted in loss of privacy, enabling of crime, declines in reading and contemplation, and weakening of in-person interactions due to overdependence on digital communication. It has also spread false information on a large scale and interfered in elections.

 

- Early human impacts on the environment included the use of fire starting nearly 800,000 years ago, which likely affected ecosystems, especially drier ones. 

- Hunting of megafauna like mammoths and giant deer beginning 400,000 years ago contributed to their extinction by the end of the Pleistocene, along with climate changes. This opened spaces for new habitat.

- Neolithic agricultural practices starting around 10,000 years ago like deforestation, wetland drainage, and animal husbandry emitted greenhouse gases. Ruddiman argues these emissions were significant and offset what would have been a natural cooling period.

- Impacts were initially limited by small human populations but the accumulated effects of activities like burning, hunting, and early farming may have transformed landscapes and contributed modestly to atmospheric changes over long periods of prehistory.

- The scale of human environmental modification grew enormously with rising populations and advanced technologies during the past two centuries, becoming a dominant force transforming the Earth system in the Anthropocene.

 

The passage discusses several major pre-modern human impacts on the biosphere and land cover/use changes from 1800 to 2000:

- Extensive deforestation occurred in parts of Asia and Europe due to land conversion for crops/pasture as well as for fuel and metal production. This largely took place before 1700 and reduced forest cover significantly in places like Central Europe and China. 

- Nighttime satellite imagery indicates dramatic changes in global land cover from 1800 to 2000, with natural ecosystems like forests, wetlands and grazing lands being replaced by cropland, settlements, industry, transportation infrastructure and urban areas. These changes were particularly transformative in the tropics and on North American and Eurasian plains. 

- Mapping technologies like satellite observations have allowed for more accurate estimates of urban land area and impervious surfaces over time. While estimates of total urban land in 2010 differ significantly (350 million ha vs 110 million ha), the data indicates substantial growth of cities and settlements globally between 1800-2000 through both expansion and merger of existing centers.

 This passage discusses deforestation and reforestation. Some key points:

- Deforestation has been driven by demands for timber, fuelwood, cropland expansion, and pastures. It has closely correlated with population growth and improved diets. 

- Estimates of pre-1980 global deforestation range from under 1 billion ha cleared to 1.39 billion ha cleared between 1700-1995. Primary forests covered around 40% of ice-free land originally, reduced to around 10% by the 21st century. 

- Deforestation rates declined in Europe/North America as coal replaced fuelwood and steel/concrete replaced wood in construction. Many affluent countries saw reforestation. 

- Global deforestation fell from 12 million ha/year pre-1950 to around 13 million ha/year 2000-2010. Rates remain high in parts of Asia, Africa, Latin America.

- Amazon deforestation increased substantially in the late 20th century before efforts were made to curb it. Brazil remains a major center of primary forest loss. Haiti has nearly lost all original forest cover.

In summary, it traces the history and drivers of deforestation globally as well as reforestation efforts in some regions and ongoing challenges in parts of the developing world.

 Here is a 40% summary:

China underwent massive reforestation after 1980, raising forest cover from less than 13% to nearly 22% by 2015. However, much of the new growth consists of fast-growing monoculture plantations, rather than natural forests. Globally, forests have acted as a major carbon sink, absorbing an estimated 2.4 billion tons of carbon per year between 1990 and 2007. 

Estimates of historical cropland and pasture extent have large errors, but both expanded slowly until 1500 and then more rapidly, driven by population growth. By 2000, cropland reached 1.59 billion hectares and pasture 3.4 billion hectares. Intensive multiple cropping is common in warmer regions, exceeding official figures. Fallow land accounts for 28% of the reported cropland area. African pastures experience frequent burning which releases vast amounts of biomass annually. Growth trajectories suggest cropland may ultimately reach 2.8 billion hectares while avoiding most conversion of remaining forests and grasslands.

 

- In many countries, agricultural intensification through improved cultivars has allowed a reduction in cultivated farmland area despite population growth, known as a "land-sparing effect." High-yielding varieties have significantly reduced land needs for crops like wheat, corn, and rice. 

- Globally, cultivated cropland area peaked in the 1950s and has since declined in North America, Europe, and the former USSR by 14-25%. The US saw a 20% reduction despite diverting more corn to ethanol. This trend suggests global cropland area may have peaked.

- However, some analyses show continued growth in global cropland area to 1.59 billion ha in 2015 and 1.87 billion ha in 2017, led by India, US, and China. Peak cropland is still plausible with intensification and reduced fallowing. 

- Overall, about 63% of ice-free land has been impacted by human activity such as agriculture, settlements, transportation, mining, and reservoirs. Including sediment deposition from human causes, the affected area is estimated at 67% or around 9 billion ha. Humans have become a major geological force shaping the planet.

So in summary, agricultural intensification has allowed some reduction in cropland area but global cropland continues growing, and over 60% of ice-free land is now impacted by human land use and related activities.

 

- Remote and isolated areas that appear untouched by humans may still have been subtly altered by atmospheric pollution from faraway sources as well as rising CO2 levels. 

- The Amazon rainforest was once thought to be pristine natural forest, until discoveries of ancient anthropogenic soils (terra preta) across the basin, showing evidence of pre-Columbian settlements and agriculture. 

- Jean-Jacques Rousseau had a similar experience while hiking deep in the Alps - believing he was the first person to reach a certain remote ravine, only to encounter signs of human activity there. 

- The first global inventory in the 1980s found about a third of continental land areas, totaling 4.8 billion hectares, remained as contiguous wilderness tracts larger than 400,000 hectares. However, wilderness loss accelerated significantly between 1993-2009. 

- Only about 23% of land outside Antarctica is now classified as wilderness, concentrated in a few countries. Marine wilderness is even more disrupted, with just 13.2% of oceans classified as such. 

- Protected areas have expanded, with over 20 million square kilometers now under some form of protection, though marine protection is much less extensive.

 

- Modern industrial fishing since the 1950s has greatly expanded fisheries operations, harvesting deeper waters and previously untouched species. This has reduced predator fish populations by half in some oceans and reduced the biomass of large species like cod and tuna by at least an order of magnitude. 

- Overfishing has led to 57% of fish stocks being fully exploited and 30% being overexploited according to the FAO. Tracking of industrial fishing vessels from 2012-2016 found they operate in over 55% of the world's oceans. 

- Loss of marine biodiversity from overfishing impairs ocean food production and makes ecosystems less resilient. Example given of increasing bluefin tuna prices, which rose over 500-fold from the late 1960s to 2018 due to scarcity.

- Aquaculture has greatly expanded to meet demand as wild fish stocks decline, but it still relies on fish inputs like anchovies and uses omega-3 fatty acids from smaller predatory fish. 

- Terrestrial defaunation has led to losses of 60% of vertebrate populations globally since 1970 per the WWF. Specific groups like amphibians and corals face 40% and 33% extinction risks respectively. 

- Environmental changes like light pollution interfere with circadian rhythms of organisms. This affects melatonin regulation in humans and may increase health risks. Urban noise and glass buildings also pose acoustic and physical interference. Large dams block fish migrations.

 

Large dams have significantly impacted environments and populations around the world. Over 57,000 large dams have been built, displacing around 40 million people from their homes. Dams impede river flows and trap sediment, depriving downstream areas of nutrient-rich materials. They alter the natural temperature cycles of river water released from reservoirs. Stagnant reservoir waters also facilitate algal blooms and invasive aquatic plant growth. 

Water stored behind large dams now represents a 700% increase in standing freshwater volume globally. Reservoir storage increases water aging before release, impacting river balances, oxygen levels, and sediment transport. Releases from deep reservoirs disrupt ecosystems by changing water temperatures in temperate regions. Nutrient-rich reservoir waters also promote algal blooms in warmer climates. Sedimentation rapidly fills some reservoirs, like some in China, within decades rather than the expected timelines.

Invasive species introductions, both purposeful and accidental, have caused widespread environmental damage. Examples highlighted are kudzu vine in the US, cane toads in Australia, chestnut blight fungus and Dutch elm disease in North America, and hemlock woolly adelgid. Eradication of invasive species is difficult and often impossible once established. Some islands have achieved success with exhaustive deratization programs.

 

Water pollution issues have expanded to include microplastics and trace residues of pharmaceuticals in wastewater. More advanced wastewater treatment is needed to remove these emerging contaminants, but remedies can be costly. 

Antibiotic resistance has developed due to overuse and misuse of antibiotics in human medicine, agriculture, and aquaculture. This poses a major threat as effective antibiotic treatments become scarce. Resistance has spread internationally through various pathways.

Plastic pollution has risen exponentially since mass production began in the mid-20th century. Most plastics persist in the environment for centuries. Much plastic waste ends up in oceans, where floating debris accumulates in garbage patches like the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. Microplastics also spread widely on land and in freshwater. 

Human activities have greatly increased the natural nitrogen and phosphorus cycles, mainly through production of nitrogen fertilizers. This nutrient enrichment has led to various environmental issues as efficiencies of nutrient recovery by crops are relatively low. Overall, new categories of water pollution and disruptions to biogeochemical cycles represent important anthropogenic changes to the environment.

 

- Excessive application of nitrogenous fertilizers has acidified soils, especially in China where high urea use to sustain rice yields has lowered soil pH on average by over 0.5 units, tripling acidity in some cases. 

- Reactive nitrogen from fertilizers enters the atmosphere and contaminates water through various pathways like leaching, runoff, and erosion. This causes greenhouse gas emissions, acidification, and eutrophication.

- Intensified fertilization has been a major factor in the creation and expansion of hypoxic "dead zones" in coastal waters worldwide. Nitrogen discharges to coastal waters rose over 40% from 1960-2000, mostly from fertilizer. 

- Improving the situation will be difficult as billions depend on nitrogen fertilizers for food. Better management could help but requires coordinated effort. Reducing meat consumption in affluent nations could also achieve savings given nitrogen inefficiencies in the food system.

- Phosphorus applications also mobilize the element beyond natural rates. Uptake efficiencies are around 50% and losses contribute to eutrophication, though phosphorus immobilizes more than nitrogen in soils. Recycling from wastes could help reduce need for phosphate fertilizers.

 

- Traditional agricultural systems could support more than 5 people or yield at least 200 kg/ha of food. China's current ratio is about 15 people or 650 kg/ha of food yield. 

- The biomass of soil fauna (earthworms, myriapods, nematodes, mites, springtails) in cropland is typically less than 100 kg/ha. High crop yields now support a higher human biomass than the total biomass of all soil invertebrates. 

- In 1900, the biomass of large domesticated animals (cattle, water buffaloes, pigs) was over 4 times the biomass of wild mammals. By 2000, it was over 25 times the biomass of wild mammals, demonstrating human dominance through domesticated animals rather than wild populations. 

- Historical deforestation and land use changes have reduced total terrestrial phytomass (plant biomass) by 35-40% since the early agricultural era. 

- Estimates of the percentage of net primary production appropriated by humans range from 10-17%, though the concept and measurement of NPP appropriation has limitations. Appropriation will continue to rise to sustain global population growth.

- Two key approaches to assessing human impact are ecological footprints/carrying capacity and defining a "safe operating space" for key Earth system processes like climate change, biodiversity loss, biogeochemical flows, etc. Several of these processes have already surpassed their identified safe boundaries.

 

- Water vapor accounts for nearly two-thirds of the greenhouse effect, warming Earth's surface to an average of 15°C. Without greenhouse gases, Earth's surface would be frozen at -18.1°C. 

- CO2 accounts for nearly a quarter of the greenhouse effect. It resides in the atmosphere for hundreds of years and has increased the radiative forcing by about 2 W/m2 since the 19th century. 

- Past CO2 levels were stable between 275-285 ppm over the past millennium but have risen rapidly in recent decades, reaching 400 ppm in 2015. 

- Other greenhouse gases like methane and nitrous oxide also contribute to warming, with methane's global warming potential being 21 times that of CO2 over 100 years. Greenhouse gas emissions are dominated by CO2 (75%) and methane (16%).

- Continued emissions increase risks further warming, especially in the Arctic and during heat waves. This could impact ecosystems, species ranges, agricultural growing seasons, and exacerbate natural disasters like wildfires.

- Limiting global warming to 1.5°C will require substantial greenhouse gas reductions by 2050, posing major economic and technological challenges. Uncertainties remain but emission trends indicate the need for rapid transition away from fossil fuels.

 

The passage argues that the rapid rates of change we have seen in recent centuries, especially in population growth, economic outputs, food/energy production, and material goods, have made dramatic transitions extraordinarily difficult going forward. Some key points:

- Global population took over 2,000 years to grow from 100 million to 1 billion in the early 1800s, but then quadrupled in just 200 years to reach 4 billion by 1960s due to unprecedented growth rates. 

- Food and energy production grew even faster than population, around 1.9-2.8% annually in the 1900s, enabling substantial per capita gains. Food output increased sevenfold. 

- Economic output grew at estimated annual rates of 2.2-2.7% from 1800-2000, well above population growth. 

- Production of materials like steel, cement, plastics increased by orders of magnitude in the 1900s due to industrialization. Electricity generation and aluminum smelting increased threefold.

The passage argues that the scales and rates of changes we have accomplished, especially in the last 200 years, have made grand transitions in the future extraordinarily challenging compared to slower changes of the past. Maintaining these rapid gains will be difficult.

 

- Long-term multiples are used to quantify gains in income, mobility, energy/material use, and information/communication over the past 200 years. 

- Per capita GDP rose 10-40x globally since 1820, with countries like Japan and the US seeing 30-40x increases. China's GDP rose 120x since economic reforms began in 1980, due to late industrialization, foreign investment, and export-oriented manufacturing. 

- Personal mobility in affluent countries, as measured by passenger-kilometers, increased about 200x in the 20th century due to cars, planes, and trains replacing early railway travel. 

- The costs of information and communication, such as international phone calls, printing, and data storage, have declined by several orders of magnitude (1,000x or more). Global data storage surpassed 16 zettabytes in 2016, over 11 orders of magnitude higher than 2000 years ago. 

- These gains across many measures are described as "truly magical" given most enabling technologies did not exist just 200 years ago, and improvements over the 20th century alone were typically 1-3 orders of magnitude.

 

- The passage discusses the views of intellectuals who have optimistic views about constant improvement and progress in the world. This includes works by Hans Rosling and Steven Pinker arguing the world is getting better in terms of health, income, living standards, etc.

- However, the author has concerns with this narrative of inevitable ongoing betterment. He argues Rosling and Pinker ignore or selectively omit facts that don't fit their claims, like issues around biodiversity loss, inequality, and ongoing wars/conflicts. 

- Specifically, the author notes Rosling's book says nothing about inequality trends or environmental issues like biodiversity decline. Pinker also ignores increasing inequality and the long-running costs and human toll of America's wars in the Middle East/Central Asia.

- In summary, the author is critiquing overly optimistic visions of the future by arguing they involve selective omission of facts and issues that point to ongoing challenges rather than just constant improvement across the board.

 

- The number of displaced people globally in 2019, totaling about 71 million worldwide, was the highest ever recorded by the UNHCR. 

- Pinker would likely classify the phenomenon of mass incarceration in the US, with nearly 2.2 million adults incarcerated, as an improvement from a utilitarian perspective since it aims to reduce crime, even if it raises ethical issues.

- While Pinker cites some environmental improvements like reduced air pollution and increased protected lands, other scientists argue extinction rates are extremely high and wilderness/habitat loss remains a major problem. These conflicting views show assessing "progress" is complex when acknowledging serious ongoing environmental degradation. 

- The view of endless exponential growth and technological solutions depicted by Kurzweil, West, Harari and others is simplistic and ignores natural limits/constraints like the dependence of agriculture on nitrogen cycling and bee pollination. Their belief that humans will become godlike through technology disregards the need to maintain planetary habitability. Progress cannot continue indefinitely without regard for environmental protection and sustainability.

As for how Pinker would classify mass incarceration, he would likely see it as an improvement from a utilitarian perspective aimed at reducing crime, even if it raises ethical issues about over-incarceration. But his views on environmental progress overlook serious ongoing problems of extinction, habitat loss, and planetary boundaries. Unrestrained beliefs in exponential growth ignore natural limits and the need for environmental stewardship.

 

- The passage criticizes other authors for failing to acknowledge the full extent of human-caused environmental transformations, from massive deforestation to antibiotic resistance to rapid melting in Antarctica. These impacts have seriously undermined the biosphere's ability to support human civilization. 

- Continued environmental degradation is inevitable as billions more people seek higher standards of living through increased consumption of energy, materials, and food. Meeting these needs threatens to push Earth past several "planetary boundaries" that should not be crossed to maintain long-term habitability. 

- Rapid transitions are needed to place modern civilization on a more environmentally sustainable path, through increased but more efficient agricultural output, access to clean energy and materials for developing countries, and reduced population growth. 

- However, expectations of very fast changes driven by exponential technological progress are unrealistic. Most inputs like crop yields, energy efficiencies improve at steady but modest rates of 1-3% per year, not the 35% annual growth seen with microchips. 

- The unprecedented scales of today's global economy, consumption and impacts mean transitions will take considerable time even with mature innovations, due to the immense scale of replacing existing systems. Long-term forecasts are difficult given uncertainty around future conditions.

 

- Post-1960 decades have seen many failed economic, energy, population and environmental forecasts due to the difficulty of predicting major shifts and accurately forecasting human innovations and behaviors over long periods of time. 

- Examples include forecasts of rapidly rising stock markets, nuclear power dominating electricity by 2000, global population growth continuing indefinitely, and promises of revolutionary new technologies that rarely materialize at large scales. 

- Rather than dubious forecasts, a more realistic approach is to outline a likely range of possibilities accounting for technical limits and recognize innovations may take decades to become widespread realities. 

- Global population growth will likely continue this century unless unprecedented fertility declines occur in sub-Saharan Africa. The UN forecasts a 40% increase to 10.9 billion people by 2100, with half the growth in Africa. 

- All societies will see increased old-age dependency ratios, rising to around 60 in Europe/China and tripling in Africa, transforming global population structures and increasing fiscal challenges of aging populations. 

- Many affluent nations face substantial population declines already, especially parts of Europe, while population aging will significantly impact China. Managing these demographic shifts brings large economic and social impacts.

 

- The US, Appalachia, and Montana are experiencing population declines or retreats, especially on the Great Plains. Several European countries like Japan, Romania, Poland, and Russia will see population declines of 7-15% by 2100 without immigration. 

- Global population is projected to increase by 3.6 billion people by 2050 to around 9.74 billion. This rate of growth is similar to the second half of the 20th century but from a higher base population. Meeting increased food and resource demands should be possible barring major environmental deterioration. 

- Population aging, smaller households, and depopulation will occur alongside continued international migration to affluent nations from Africa, Central/South America, Asia, and within Europe despite countermeasures. Migration will help reduce global inequality. 

- By 2050, food demand is projected to increase 60% overall and 70% for animal foods. Meeting these demands requires continued productivity gains, intensification, expansion onto new farmland (mainly in Africa/Latin America), waste reduction, and diet changes. 

- Closing yield gaps through better varieties, fertilization, and practices can boost supplies, especially in sub-Saharan Africa which currently imports staple foods despite agricultural potential. New technologies like reducing crop photorespiration may enable higher yields. 

- Animal agriculture can be optimized through practices like India's more efficient milk production and limiting resource-intensive beef in favor of chicken, fish, and dairy. Bioreactor "meats" and plant-based alternatives may also play a role.

 

- The world's population is expected to increase substantially in the coming decades, adding nearly as many people as in the second half of the 20th century. Nearly half of this increase will come from Africa, mostly from sub-Saharan Africa. This presents challenges for assuring adequate food supply. 

- Concerns about China's ability to feed itself in the 1990s turned out to be unfounded, as improved agricultural practices allowed China to meet its food needs. Continued improvements are expected to allow China to manage its food supply, even as its population declines slightly by 2050. 

- India faces greater challenges in feeding its growing population, which will increase by 600 million by 2050. However, India also has opportunities for agricultural intensification and productivity growth to help meet rising demand. 

- Many countries in sub-Saharan Africa like the Sahel region have struggled with food insecurity and may continue to do so given vulnerabilities to climate and governance issues. 

- Reductions in food waste and shifts towards healthier, more sustainable diets could help address global food needs within planetary boundaries. However, the scale of changes needed presents major challenges.

- Decarbonizing the global energy supply is necessary given the limited duration of fossil fuel resources, but transitioning away from fuels that powered modern civilization will be difficult.

 

- While concerns about running out of fossil fuels were unfounded, transitioning away from fossil fuels solely based on costs would be too slow to meaningfully address climate change. 

- The goal is to satisfy energy needs without adding any more CO2 from burning fossil fuels. Biomass could be used if the carbon is recaptured by plant growth. Even some fossil fuel use may be allowed if the CO2 is captured and stored. 

- Globally we remain heavily reliant on fossil fuels, which provided around 90% of primary energy in 2017. Total fossil fuel consumption and CO2 emissions have grown significantly over the past 25 years. 

- Large-scale energy transitions typically unfold over generations. In the past 25 years, renewable energy growth has been rapid but fossil fuel dominance has not changed due to strong overall energy demand growth. 

- Transitioning electricity generation is easier than other sectors but achieving fully decarbonized power is challenging. Renewables provide a small share of total primary energy globally due to intermittency issues and lack of large-scale cost-effective storage. 

- High renewable penetration can lead to oversupply and negative prices at times. Maintaining backups also adds costs, contrary to arguments about renewables being inherently low cost. Rapid transition will be difficult without major technological and infrastructure changes.

 

- Renewable energy sources like solar and wind are impractical for large cities due to their intermittent nature and the huge storage capacity required. For example, Tokyo would need $500 billion worth of batteries just to store enough energy for 3 days during a storm. 

- The most cost-effective large-scale storage is pumped hydro, but it requires specific terrain and has energy losses during pumping. Other storage technologies are not scalable to the GW level needed for cities. 

- Transportation will be difficult to decarbonize. Biofuels make up a small fraction of fuel demand currently and cannot scale rapidly. Electric vehicles are growing but won't dominate until at least 2040. Electrifying trucks, ships, and planes faces huge challenges due to current battery limitations. 

- Many industrial processes rely on fuels that cannot be fully replaced by electricity with current technologies. Alternatives are often not affordable compared to natural gas. Industries like steel and plastics production require carbon inputs that have no mass-scale replacements.

- The global energy system relies on fossil fuels for over 80% of energy. Replacing the infrastructure and systems at the terra-ton scale would cost over $30 trillion. National efforts alone cannot replace global emissions growth. Projections of rapid decarbonization are unrealistic given the complexity and scale of the transition required.

 

- Hydrogen has potential as a future fuel but electricity also has potential advantages with advancements in energy storage. It's too early to say which will dominate. 

- Better measures are needed to assess economic activity and energy use, the key driver of prosperity. Factors like inequality, poverty, environmental degradation should be included. 

- Environmental performance should also be systematically tracked to understand issues like pollution exposure, resource management, and more. 

- Mainstream economics has largely ignored the central role of energy and materials in enabling economic growth and development. This disregard fails to recognize physical/environmental constraints. 

- Long-term economic and environmental transitions require fundamentally rethinking the relationship between growth, energy/resource use, and the environment. Simply hoping impacts can be decoupled via efficiency gains is not sufficient given physical limits. 

- Efficiency improvements have led to relative reductions, but not absolute declines globally, as consumption and population increase. National declines also don't account for offshoring carbon-intensive industries or imports. 

- Many processes are approaching theoretical efficiency limits, so further relative reductions will be challenging in some areas.

 

- Aircraft engine manufacturers have allowed reducing blade counts on some engines from 22 to 18 blades. However, a turbofan engine cannot physically operate with just a single blade. 

- While individual aircraft components have become lighter, total air travel has increased enormously globally due to rising demand. Planes may use materials more efficiently but total miles flown has increased 40-fold since 1958, negating efficiency gains. Air travel continues rising rapidly in Asia and taking off in Africa. 

- This contrast between relative dematerialization and continued strong absolute growth in demand for materials is a common reality. Efficiency reductions do not decrease total demand as populations and economies grow. There is no near-term prospect for reducing absolute material and energy consumption globally due to rising living standards in developing nations. 

- Global supply chains mean it is impossible to reduce transportation energy needs. Modern aircraft source parts from around the world requiring huge ships, planes, railroads, and trucks to integrate manufacturing and keep costs affordable. Complex global supply webs are now deeply embedded in the economy.

 

- Rising incomes lead to more energy-intensive consumption like larger homes, cars, and long-distance travel. China shows how rapidly demand can grow as incomes rise. 

- Many developing regions still lack sufficient access to energy, materials, food, healthcare, education to provide a decent standard of living. Reducing this inequality is a moral imperative but will require substantially higher energy and resource use. 

- Africa and parts of Asia and Latin America need large increases in energy, steel, cement, fertilizer consumption to develop infrastructure and housing as China and India have. Simply reaching the global average GDP would require doubling global energy and resource use. 

- Achieving America's upper-middle class lifestyle for all would require a 25-fold increase in energy use for the global poor. Reductions in rich countries alone cannot close this gap given population growth in poorer nations. 

- Transitioning to non-carbon energy sources by 2050, as the IPCC recommends, would require an extraordinary shift away from fossil fuels through rapid emission cuts and carbon removal technologies. However, such scenarios are difficult to achieve practically.

 

The passage argues that techno-optimists who believe technological and scientific innovations will solve problems like climate change have unrealistic expectations. Even with improvements, global demands for food, energy, and materials will significantly increase by 2050 due to population growth. Radical decarbonization is unlikely given current technology limits. 

Apocalyptic predictions of imminent collapse are counterproductive and underestimate humanity's ability to adapt. However, efficiency gains and moderate consumption alone may not be enough for a sustainable civilization. Geoengineering proposals to alter the climate are theoretically promising but risky without understanding all consequences. 

The most likely near-term outcome is a gradual stabilization and slow decline in emissions through widespread adaptation efforts, not rapid transformation. Affluent countries need to commit to moderation but elections favor short-term thinking. While continuous progress on efficiency and rational use are urgent, we must acknowledge the immense challenges of reconciling economic growth with environmental impacts.

 

- Acting preemptively on climate change is preferable but historically challenging; adaptation efforts are easier for affluent countries due to indicators like life expectancy already leveling off at $20,000 GDP per capita. 

- Climate models have improved but still have uncertainties around factors like solar activity, cloud physics, and feedbacks. A 20-year study showed C3 and C4 plant responses to CO2 were opposite of initial expectations. 

- Drought response is important but models may underestimate impacts, as one study found the actual carbon-climate feedback was larger than models predicted. Reports of increased greening globally rely on unsustainable intensive cropping and monoculture tree planting.

- Many uncertainties exist around factors like Antarctic ice melt, ocean oxygen levels, and permafrost thaw feedbacks. Methane seeps may be carbon sinks rather than sources. Predicting national responses is difficult given varying outcomes between countries like China and Nigeria.  

- Due to uncertainties, an eclectic, flexible approach is needed over doctrinaire solutions. This applies to energy systems, transportation, agriculture, focusing on diversity, waste reduction, and inherent limits.

 

- The passage discusses different outcomes that could occur related to climate change and global warming. It outlines a spectrum of possibilities from more mild/bearable consequences to more severe/perilous consequences. 

- It notes that the equilibrium climate sensitivity and levels of carbon emissions could remain low/manageable or exceed expectations. Natural responses like carbon storage may help buffer impacts more or less than predicted. 

- The most likely outcome will be a mixed combination of factors across this spectrum of possibilities, rather than a single clear outcome. Even probabilistic assessments are just educated guesses. 

- Looking back to 1940, the world of 2100 is impossible to fully anticipate due to drastic technological, economic, social, and environmental changes that occurred. The future remains uncertain but humanity retains the ability to choose trajectories and alternatives through its decisions. 

- The coming transition to operating within planetary boundaries will likely involve both aggressive innovation and inexplicable delays, as well as adaptation successes and failures to respond adequately. Major transformations over the century are still contingent on human choices.

 Here is a summary of the key points from the article "We must make nature worthless" by Brendan O'Neill published on September 18, 2015 in RealClearScience:

- The article criticizes the idea that nature should be valued purely based on economic costs and benefits to humans. It argues this reduces nature to an economic resource for human use.

- O'Neill argues this economic view of nature, where its worth is based only on human preferences and needs, threatens to reduce biodiversity and other natural phenomena to disposable goods. 

- He says placing an economic value on nature can encourage the view that its protection depends on proving economic benefits to humans, rather than recognizing nature has worth beyond its utility to humans. 

- The article warns this approach could see more natural areas degraded or destroyed if they are not found to provide sufficient economic value compared to other land uses. 

- O'Neill argues nature should be recognized as having intrinsic worth beyond its economic value to humans. Its protection should not depend entirely on economic arguments but recognition of its inherent value.

- In summary, the article criticizes reducing nature to an economic resource and says this could threaten biodiversity if protection depends solely on demonstrating nature's economic worth to people. It argues nature has value beyond just economic costs and benefits.

 Here is a summary of the paper:

The paper "Record Flows and Growing Imbalances: Chinese Investment in Europe in 2016" by Hanemann and Huotari examines trends in Chinese foreign direct investment (FDI) in Europe in 2016. Some key findings include:

- China's outbound FDI to Europe reached $35 billion in 2016, an increase of 23% over 2015 and establishing a new record high. 

- Large investments focused on strategic sectors like automotive, infrastructure and energy. China also continued establishing investment funds focused on Europe.

- However, the growth in Chinese FDI outpaced two-way investment, contributing to an increasing imbalance in investment flows between China and Europe. Europe's FDI into China declined.

- Challenges include managing the political backlash against Chinese investments in some European countries and limiting excess capacity resulting from some investments. More policy coordination is needed to balance investment flows and maximize benefits for both sides.

- Overall the trends point to continued growth in Chinese FDI in Europe but also the need for policies to guide investment into mutually beneficial areas and address concerns over some deals. Managing the political dynamics will also be important going forward.

 Here is a summary of the key points from the provided sections:

- Eld operations (farming) have high energy requirements due to mechanization. Transition to modern farming has made agriculture less labor-intensive but more energy-intensive. 

- Deforestation, mainly due to expanding croplands and pastures, has contributed significantly to environmental changes like loss of biodiversity and carbon emissions. Many regions like Amazonia and Indonesia have seen large-scale deforestation.

- Modern industrialized farming relies on mechanization, synthetic fertilizers and other inputs, concentrated animal feeding operations, monocultures, and other techniques that have increased yields but impacted environments. 

- Many countries have seen structural shifts in industries like increased aluminum and composite materials in aircraft replacing metals like steel. Electrification of transport has provided efficiency benefits. 

- Rapid urbanization and city growth in places like China, India and other parts of Asia have led to environmental issues like increased pollution, loss of wilderness areas, and expansion of impervious surfaces.

- Dietary transitions in countries like China involving increased consumption of meat, oils, sugar and other calorie-dense foods have placed additional demands on agriculture and land use. Future food requirements are a concern in some projections.

- Energy transitions involving shifts from traditional biomass to fossil fuels like coal have powered industrialization but also increased pollution levels. Countries are now transitioning to more sustainable energy sources.

 

- China's population is undergoing transitions including slowing population growth, aging, and potential future population decline. The one-child policy helped reduce fertility rates. Urbanization is increasing rapidly. 

- Dams can impact the environment through changes to water flows. Multicropping and improving nitrogen efficiency can boost agricultural yields. Ocean dead zones are impacted by nutrients like phosphates from wastewater. China faces challenges from pollution including plastics and soil acidification. 

- Fertility rates have declined significantly in countries like China, Colombia, Congo, and throughout much of East Asia due to development factors. This has contributed to demographic dividends but also potential future issues like an increasing demographic burden. 

- Economic growth has historically come from a variety of sources including improvements in agriculture, industry, technology, trade, and resource inputs. Most countries transitioned from agriculture-dominated to industry-dominated to service-dominated economies. Information and communication technologies now play a large role. 

- Energy transitions included shifting from animate power to water and wind power, then to coal and oil. Electrification and more efficient engines drove major changes. Future transitions may focus on decarbonization and developing sustainable systems.

 

- The tenment system in Europe during the late Middle Ages resulted in overuse of resources and land degradation as population grew. Landlords had little incentive to improve lands or practice sustainable management. 

- Agricultural production is a major cause of environmental damage and degradation, through processes like monocropping, use of irrigation, fertilizers, and pesticides. 

- Food waste that ends up in landfills is a global issue, contributing to agricultural pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and wasted resources. 

- Future increases in global population and changing diets will put more pressure on food systems and likely cause greater environmental impacts unless agricultural practices are reformed. 

- Major environmental transitions have occurred through human activities like transformation of croplands and pastures, deforestation/reforestation, changes to biogeochemical cycles and climate change, pollution from synthetic materials and antibiotic overuse. 

- Possible future environmental transitions include moves toward more sustainable agriculture, renewable energy, reduced material consumption, urbanization, and conservation efforts to mitigate impacts of population and economic growth on ecosystems.

In summary, the passage discusses the environmental impacts and degradation caused by tenantry systems, agriculture, food waste, and population/economic growth historically and possible future trajectories depending on policy and behavioral changes. Sustainable reforms will be needed to support future populations while protecting the environment.

 Here is a summary of some of the key points from the provided text:

- Gibbs, John D. was an early expert on glass production. Glassmaking expanded significantly from the late medieval period onward. 

- The Great Leap Forward in China from 1958-1962 led to famine and millions of deaths due to failed economic policies.

- The Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services produced by the IPBES examines the impacts of humanity on biodiversity and nature. 

- Global economic output has seen rates of accelerated growth since the Industrial Revolution, driven by factors like technological innovation.

- Google, as one of the largest companies in the world today, demonstrates how information technologies have grown enormously. 

- The growth of government bureaucracies increased substantially from the late 18th century onward in many countries. 

- The Great Pacific Garbage Patch refers to a large area of floating plastic waste in the North Pacific Ocean. 

- International migrations increased significantly in the late 20th century, both within and between countries.

- Urban population growth has far outpaced rural population growth in most countries over the last century, leading to megacity expansion. 

- Population aging is a major trend underway as fertility rates decline and lifespans increase in many societies. Japan faces a very aged population profile in the coming decades.

 Here are summaries of the key points about Kuwait, obesity in and Kuznets, Simon:

Kuwait, obesity in, 106
- Very brief mention that obesity is an issue in Kuwait 

Kuznets, Simon, 168, 279–80
- Simon Kuznets was an economist who theorized that as economies develop and shift from agricultural to industrial/service sectors, inequality first rises and then falls in an inverted U-shaped pattern. This pattern became known as the "Kuznets curve".
- His work in the 1950s and 1960s helped establish the idea that economic development could eventually reduce inequality.
- He won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1971.

So in summary, the first entry notes obesity is a problem in Kuwait, and the second provides more context around the prominent 20th century economist Simon Kuznets and his influential theories around economic development and inequality.

 

- On: Refers to page numbers in a source text. 

- 57, 59, 68–69: Page numbers where information about migrations and urbanization can be found. Urbanization grew rapidly in the 20th century, with 58-62% of people living in cities by the late 20th century. Megacities of over 10 million people emerged, bringing challenges of governance, infrastructure, pollution, etc. 

- Paris Agreement (2016), 288: The Paris Agreement was an international agreement to tackle climate change signed in 2016. 

- Parkesine, 231–32: Parkesine was an early plastic material made from nitrocellulose. 

- Parsons, Charles A., 135: Charles Parsons was an engineer who developed the steam turbine. 

- pastures and cropland, 214–17: References pages about changes in pastures and cropland due to human activities like agriculture expansion. 

- peat, as energy source, 115: Peat was sometimes used as an energy source before widespread fossil fuel use.
