 Here is a summary of the key points from the chapter:

- Positive thinking alone is often not enough to attract what you want in life. Just thinking positively doesn't address the underlying beliefs that may be blocking you. 

- The law of attraction responds to your vibration/frequency, not your words. To change your outcomes, you need to honestly understand and shift your true feelings and beliefs. 

- Limiting beliefs are unconsciously held ideas like "I have to work hard for money" or "I'm not good enough." They act as a filter and limit your natural attraction powers. 

- By the time you're an adult, you've accumulated thousands of limiting beliefs from life experiences. These beliefs corrode your natural "magnetism" to easily attract what you want. 

- Simply thinking positive doesn't change the beliefs. In fact, it can make the situation worse by ignoring true feelings. To attract at a higher level, beliefs must be identified and changed through inner work.

- Changing limiting beliefs is like clearing the dirt from your magnet. It restores your natural power to effortlessly attract circumstances and things that match your highest vibrations.

 

- Limiting beliefs are usually unconscious and filter how you perceive and experience the Law of Attraction. They can prevent you from practicing LOA at a high vibration.

- To shift your vibration and results, focus on inner work like identifying limiting beliefs and shifting your beliefs and vibrations. This will lead to more organic and enjoyable manifestation. 

- Working on limiting beliefs helps you understand how reality works and what actions to take for each desire. It prevents self-blame when things don't manifest. 

- Emotions indicate your vibrational alignment. Feeling good means alignment, feeling bad means misalignment due to limiting beliefs. 

- Limiting beliefs take the form of "I can't feel x without y". For example, "I can't feel secure without a job."

- Repressed emotions like fear, sadness, guilt glue limiting beliefs in place. You need to address both the belief and corresponding emotion.

- Emotions aren't bad, they indicate beliefs. It's important to feel comfortable with a wide range of emotions to do this work. 

- Society pressures people not to fully experience emotions, but this prevents emotional release and change at the belief level.

 Here is a summary of the key points about emotions from the passage:

- Emotions are not logical, so you can't think or reason your way out of them. They need to be fully felt and expressed. 

- Working through limiting emotional beliefs may feel like an emotional "cleanse" where stored up negative emotions are released. This can cause mood swings and negative feelings to surface. 

- Don't try to suppress or avoid your emotions - let yourself feel them fully without judgment. Expressing emotions is healthy and helps release emotional blocks.

- Emotions each have their own internal logic and purpose as messengers from your soul/intuition. Imposing mental frameworks on them can confuse things. 

- There is a "tipping point" where an emotion becomes impossible to avoid feeling. It's best to surrender to the emotion once this threshold is passed rather than trying to change your mood.

- Riding out emotions without judgment allows them to be flushed from your system naturally over time. Repeated expression of all emotions leads to increased emotional well-being.

The key takeaway is that fully experiencing one's emotions is an important part of releasing limiting beliefs and improving overall vibration/energy. Logic and suppression don't work - expression and acceptance are needed.

 

- The passage discusses the art of changing beliefs using emotions as the doorway. Emotions are what "glue" beliefs in place, so to change a belief you need to shift the corresponding emotion. 

- An example is given of a belief that one needs to put others' needs before their own. This was adopted due to a past fear but now limits the person. Simply thinking new thoughts won't work - the negative emotion like guilt must be felt and moved through.

- Some tools for belief changing are willingness, imagination, and focus. One must be willing to do the work, value all emotions without judgment, and believe change is possible. Imagination is key to access desired feelings. Focus is needed to stay on track amid difficult emotions.

- A two-part exercise is proposed to diagnose current blocks and then change a simple belief. The first part involves focusing on a desired outcome and identifying any negative emotions or apprehensions. 

- The second part walks through a six-step process to change a belief: find conflicting evidence, be open to a new belief, imagine the positive feelings of the new belief, focus only on those feelings, find real-world evidence, and affirm the new belief. An example applying this to the belief "I have no idea how to get what I want" is provided.

 

- Core beliefs are often hidden and difficult to identify directly. They are propped up and reinforced by secondary, supporting beliefs accumulated over time. 

- To change a core belief, you often need to start by working on visible secondary beliefs and shifting them first. This process will help dismantle the network of beliefs.

- Emotions act as "glue" that holds beliefs in place. You need to dissolve the emotional components before changing the beliefs themselves. 

- One way to dissolve the emotional glue is to focus directly on and amplify the negative emotional state, rather than trying to think your way out of it. This brings more associated thoughts and memories to the surface that can be processed and released. 

- Repeatedly focusing on and expanding the negative emotion, without attempting to reason with or mitigate it, allows it to be fully felt and expressed. Over time this weakens its emotional charge and grip on the underlying beliefs.

The key is using focused attention and the law of attraction to bring unconscious beliefs and emotions into awareness, where they can be addressed and shifted through emotional processing and release, rather than direct confrontation or willpower.

 

The passage provides guidance on how to change really stuck beliefs that are difficult to shift, even after expressing emotions around the topic. It recommends focusing on the physical feelings in the body and letting the emotions flow naturally without judgment. 

It then suggests getting curious about core beliefs by reflecting on similar feelings from other past experiences. Recalling a formative memory in detail can help uncover the "glue" maintaining the stuck belief. 

The key step is using present-day wisdom to compassionately shift one's emotional response within the remembered scenario. This involves visualizing communicating with one's past self in a way that generates a better feeling. The goal is to manipulate symbolic representations in the mind to achieve an emotional result.

Shifting one's internal experience of the memory is meant to loosen the emotional charge and underlying beliefs sustained by that memory. Once complete, the original desired belief shift should feel more accessible. Regular belief work can help solidify the changed perspective over time.

 

- Doing emotional shifting techniques like those described can help you feel more empowered, free, heard, respected, loved, and confident. The more you practice these techniques, the easier they will get and the less afraid you will be to delve into underlying emotional memories and beliefs.

- An advanced technique called the "good parent exercise" involves roleplaying as both a good, wise parent and as your inner troubled child. This allows you to experience emotions in a pure way and reconcile different parts of yourself. 

- As you do this exercise, your inner child may open up about feelings, needs and truths you have hidden or forgotten. The parent role is to listen without judgment and validate the child. This builds trust so core desires can emerge. 

- After changing a limiting belief, expect subtle shifts initially that build over time. You may approach problems differently, stop old patterns, feel clearer/freer but also sad. New opportunities will emerge as blocked beliefs are removed. 

- Don't expect instant results but beautiful, natural evolutions that feed you. Feel more like your true self with integrated child/parent. Make peace with emotions and harness positive thinking. The universe will support your expansion.
