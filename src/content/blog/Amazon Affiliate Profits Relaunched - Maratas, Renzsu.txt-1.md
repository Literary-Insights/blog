- The best approach is to build multiple niche affiliate websites dedicated to high-converting topics. Successful affiliates put a lot of effort into constantly updating their sites to keep content relevant.

- In the beginning, focus on collecting long-tail and low-search keywords through research. These help rank sites higher. 

- Write lengthy, helpful content rather than sales pitches. Lengthy content allows covering topics comprehensively. 

- Use quality hosting services, as slow sites hurt rankings. 

- Social media is important but not the main focus, as it takes time away from sites. 

- Become an authority in niches by answering common questions on forums and sites.

- Amazon offers "native shopping ads" like recommendation, search, and custom ads to earn affiliate income without links on pages. 

- "Astores" allow easily embedding an Amazon storefront into Facebook pages for social media promotions. Making a few code changes embeds the aStore into the Facebook page tab.

In summary, successful Amazon affiliates focus on building multiple niche sites, constantly improving content, keywords research, and authority to earn high incomes over time from their Amazon associate businesses.
