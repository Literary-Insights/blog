 Here is a summary of the key points from the beginning of the book:

- The author is a psychologist who has just opened her private practice. She is eager but naive about the messy realities of clinical psychology. 

- Her first patient is Laura Wilkes, a 26-year-old woman working in human resources at a securities firm. Laura was referred due to frequent herpes outbreaks that weren't being controlled by medication.

- Laura tells the psychologist she has herpes but is otherwise unaffected by stress. She just wants to decrease her stress levels to stop the outbreaks. 

- Laura refuses to give any family history, saying she doesn't want to discuss her past. This surprises the psychologist as patients normally provide this information.

- The psychologist realizes she will need to proceed at Laura's pace to keep her engaged in therapy. Her goal is to understand what stress means to Laura and uncover its underlying causes. 

- While Laura seems practically-minded and just wants a "cure," the psychologist sees similarities to her own determined personality and feels she can relate to Laura. This initial connection is important for building the therapeutic relationship.

That covers the key details presented about the psychologist, her new patient Laura, and the beginnings of their therapeutic relationship. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions.

 Here is a summary:

- Laura created an elaborate stress chart with columns listing various "assholes" in her life causing her stress, including her boss, boyfriend, and father. 

- Her father gave her a powerful message as a child that she had to be strong and not complain to receive love and affection. The concept of unconditional love was foreign to her.

- Her mother died unexpectedly when Laura was young. Laura found her mother's body and had to take care of things, with little support from extended family. Her only memory of her mother was receiving a toy stove. 

- Laura's father was emotionally unavailable and unstable, working odd jobs like a chip truck. He abandoned Laura and her siblings alone in a remote cottage when Laura was 9, forcing her to take care of them. 

- Laura viewed this more as her father having "no choice" than feeling abandoned. She defended herself from feelings of loss by bonding very closely to her father and focusing on survival plans rather than feelings as a young child.

- Laura's upbringing led her to see feelings as luxuries and prioritize using her "wits" over exploring emotions. This informed her attitudes about stress and relationships as an adult.

 Here is a summary:

- The narrator was a young teenager whose father developed a brain tumor and lost his business. The narrator had to work two jobs to support the family financially. 

- As a new therapist, the narrator took on Laura as a client. Laura showed little emotion and denied having any stress or issues to work through in therapy. 

- The narrator joined a peer supervision group and was criticized for not accessing Laura's feelings enough. This made the narrator reflect on how their own trauma history may be impacting the therapy.

- Laura revealed she was abandoned as a child and had to care for her two younger siblings alone in a remote cabin for 6-7 months. She maintained a logical, problem-solving mindset to survive. 

- Laura strongly refused any empathy, sympathy or discussion of feelings from the therapist. The therapist agreed to this boundary reluctantly to keep Laura in therapy.

- Over sessions, the therapist pushed Laura to examine unhealthy relationship patterns and how she normalized mistreatment from men in her life. Laura strongly defended her perspectives and grew angry at challenges to her worldview.

- The narrator realized they needed to gain Laura's trust and perspective before interpreting or challenging her views more directly. It would take time to chip away at her defenses.

 Here is a summary:

- Laura recounted a dream about Colonel Potter from the TV show M*A*S*H, describing him as kind and dependable. 

- Laura was reluctant to discuss what Colonel Potter meant to her or her past, saying it would make the therapist think she deserved her herpes. 

- Laura then described living with her two younger siblings at age 9 after her father left, and how she resorted to theft to provide food and clothes for them. She would yell at and hit her siblings if they cried or complained.

- She started using Colonel Potter as a father figure, pretending he was advising her on TV about how to handle situations with her siblings. His message of focusing on having each other rather than gifts helped her become more compassionate. 

- Pretending her brother Craig was the character Radar and she was Colonel Potter, she was able to address Craig's bedwetting problem by comforting him rather than yelling.

 Here is a summary:

The bedwetting by Laura's brother Craig stopped after about a week of Laura repeating reassuring words to him and their sister Tracy that were originally said to Laura by Colonel Potter, a comforting figure from her dreams. Laura told them they would all grow up, get married, and have loving partners who wanted the best for them, like Colonel Potter. This helped them get through the difficult time they were experiencing.

 Here is a summary:

- Laura had assumed a "savior" role with her father and ex-boyfriend Ed, enabling their irresponsible behavior to try and care for them. 

- The therapist's goal was to help Laura recognize this pattern and establish healthy boundaries. 

- Laura defended Ed's actions like losing his job and selling drugs. She struggled to set boundaries with him.

- The therapist targeted Laura's relationship with her boss Clayton as an opportunity for her to change her behavior and stop enabling him. 

- When Clayton was fired, Laura was promoted, giving her a sense of power. 

- Laura eventually confronted Ed about his cheating and disease transmission, ending their relationship. 

- The biggest challenge remaining was disrupting Laura's attachment to her father, who had abandoned the family years ago but remained important to her. 

- Laura's dreams provided insights into how her relationship with her father was changing on an unconscious level, as dreams can reveal hidden drives and meanings.

 Here is a summary:

- Laura had a vivid dream where she was on stage in ragged clothes in front of an audience. A giant paper mache cat appeared and while the band Poison played "Look What the Cat Dragged In", she violently kicked the cat until it cracked and fell apart. 

- The song originated from recently hearing it at her sister's house. The phrase "Look what the cat dragged in" reminded her of when her father said it to her when she visited him in prison as a teenager.

- Laura revealed her father had been in prison, which surprised her therapist. She didn't know why he was in jail. When she visited him at 14 after taking a long bus ride, her father laughed at her appearance and other inmates ogled her while he did nothing. 

- In therapy, Laura expressed anger towards her father for the first time. She realized she had mistakenly bonded with and cared for him out of duty rather than actual love. 

- Memories from her childhood emerged, like when her father abruptly showed up after years and took Laura and her siblings from their caring foster family. 

- They moved in with her father and new much younger wife Linda above a bar. Linda was mean when drunk and Laura's father would beat Linda, which Laura witnessed. 

- One night after a binge, Laura's father got in an argument with Linda and there was a commotion. Laura found Linda unconscious at the bottom of the stairs with a broken neck. Her father was drunk but unharmed. Laura covered for him by lying to police about what happened.

 Here is a summary:

- Laura revealed that both her grandparents had died, but she referred to them as "cretins" and said living with them after her father went to prison was traumatic. 

- She lived with them in a trailer park from age 14-15. They were described as "stupid as posts" and "gave white trailer trash a bad name." 

- Laura said they would get mad over small things and beat her with a belt, locking her in a closet for 24 hours once when she brought the wrong canned corn from the store. 

- They also verbally abused her, telling her she and her father were no good like her "wop" mother who trapped and ruined his life.

- Laura mentioned her grandfather was "oddly sexual" towards her, checking her virginity and making comments about her looks. 

- She implied but did not confirm any improper sexual behavior from the grandfather. Laura dismissed it, saying he was a coward and her grandmother had the real power.

- The therapist wondered if there was more sexual abuse Laura wasn't revealing, as people from chaotic backgrounds are more vulnerable, though Laura insisted no one touched her.

- While strong and refusing a victim role, the therapist noted Laura's psychological denial of pain still had negative impacts.

 Here is a summary:

- Laura struggled to acknowledge her true feelings of fear, loneliness and abandonment from her childhood, and instead felt only anger as a defense mechanism. Her psychologist's job was to help her connect to her real feelings. 

- One key lesson was that psychologists cannot judge others. Though Laura's father had many flaws, understanding his own troubled upbringing provided context for why he struggled as a parent. 

- Laura's sister Tracy was struggling after her husband's suicide, leaving her alone with three children. Laura provided much hands-on help but struggled with emotional intimacy. 

- The psychologist encouraged Laura to try sharing her inner feelings with Tracy through emotional intimacy and vulnerability. This went against Laura's upbringing where sharing pain wasn't seen as strength.

- Laura had a troubling experience after opening up to Tracy. In a shocking revelation, Tracy disclosed that their father had sexually abused her as a child. Laura was left reeling from this traumatic information from her sister.

 Here is a summary:

- Laura recounted meeting with her estranged sister Tracy recently, where Tracy accused their father of sexually abusing her as a child. Laura's father vehemently denied the allegations when Laura confronted him. 

- Laura is skeptical of Tracy's claims, citing that Tracy often plays the victim and was jealous of Laura's relationship with their father. However, the therapist points out they have no way of truly knowing what happened.

- They discuss Tracy's mental health issues and Laura's patterns of defending her father. The therapist tried to get Tracy help but she was resistant. They agree they will never know the true facts of what occurred.

- The session ends with Laura acknowledging they can't know the truth. The therapist then switches focus back to Laura's ongoing therapy work and progress in addressing her issues from a dysfunctional childhood.

- In summary, the session deals with Laura processing a serious allegation from her sister regarding their father, and wrestling with defending her perspective vs acknowledging limitations in truly knowing what occurred as children. The therapist provides perspective but ultimately agrees the truth cannot be unequivocally determined.

 Here is a summary:

- Laura went on a disastrous date set up by her friend Kathy. The guy, Steve, was too nice and helpful for Laura's liking. She found him boring. 

- Laura's therapist calls her out for rejecting Steve due to his kindness and questions what she knows about his risk-taking or competetive career. 

- Laura admits she's attracted to "bad boys" like her father and ex-boyfriend. Her therapist argues she may be bonded to that behavior as it was familiar to her from childhood. 

- Laura begins dating Steve regularly and tries to learn how a normal relationship functions. When she confesses her herpes to him, he disappears for weeks, leaving Laura hurt and ashamed. 

- After working through her feelings with her therapist, Steve eventually returns, having educated himself on safe sex practices. Their relationship continues for months. 

- However, Laura becomes upset again when Steve only gives her one rose for Valentine's Day, as gift-giving is more modest in his family who value experiences over possessions.

 Here is a summary:

- Laura viewed lavish spending as romantic, while Steve saw it as extravagant. They weathered a disagreement over Valentine's gifts. 

- Laura visited Steve's family home and received a homemade Christmas sweater she found very unfashionable. She joked about being stuck wearing it whenever they were together. 

- Laura was learning to adapt to Steve's more middle-class and dependable lifestyle. She appreciated his long-term goals and their savings. Steve appreciated her work ethic.

- Laura told Steve she wanted to hear compliments, since that's what she was used to. Steve started regularly telling her how beautiful she was.

- Laura threw a pasta sauce container against the wall during an argument over Steve only saving a tablespoon of sauce. Steve left for a week, saying her anger was intolerable. 

- Laura was reluctant when Steve wanted to start his own business, fearing risk and changes like in her unstable childhood. She eventually supported his calculated decision.

- Laura had to introduce her dysfunctional family to Steve's at Thanksgiving. Things went smoothly due to her precautions. 

- Laura and Steve got married at Christmas after years of therapy together, which was deemed finished. Laura was very emotional at their final session, showing progress in becoming more "normal."

 Here is a summary:

- The passage provides background on Laura, describing her natural gifts of beauty, intelligence and a strong temperament. As the eldest child, she took on responsibility and learned how to get what little affection her unreliable father could provide. 

- Years after therapy ended, Laura sent the author newspaper articles about her abusive father completing a domestic violence program. She had overcome her tendency to choose unreliable partners.

- Laura also sent a picture of a fishing boat she bought for her foster father Ron, who had provided stability in her childhood. 

- When they met years later, Laura had a successful career and marriage. Her brothers struggled more - one died alone at a young age, and her sister became an alcoholic, lost her legs to infection and died young as well. 

- Laura felt fulfilled through her work helping others with disabilities. She recognized the author helped her understand what was driving her behavior. Laura believed staying with her more supportive foster parents may have helped her siblings fare better.

- The passage ends with Laura briefly seeing her abusive father on the street years later, but being able to avoid him without feeling shaken, showing her personal growth.

 Here is a summary:

- Peter was a patient seeking help for erectile dysfunction and loneliness. Exams by urologists found no physical cause, so he was referred to psychotherapy. 

- Peter recounted his family history, including his father's death from heart attack brought on by diabetes complications and overeating sweets given to him by Peter's mother. 

- Peter described being locked alone in the attic of his family's Chinese restaurant from a very young age (before age 2) until age 5, while his parents worked long hours running the restaurant. He would be left food for the day and slept up in the attic. 

- This isolation and neglect during crucial childhood developmental stages likely had long-term psychological impacts on Peter. He normalized the abuse, believing it was for the benefit of the family and what all Chinese immigrants had to endure. 

- Peter recalled traumatic memories from that time like using a sharp canned food can as a toilet and being beaten with a bamboo whip by his mother if he caused her extra work or misbehaved.

So in summary, Peter describes experiencing extreme neglect and isolation as a very young child that was likely psychologically abusive and impactful on his development and current difficulties.

 Here is a summary:

- Peter grew up in an attic above his mother's restaurant, isolated and lonely. His only companion was a toy piano given to him by his mother. 

- His father lost the family's savings, causing stress in the marriage. They moved to Toronto where his mother worked long hours. 

- Peter started kindergarten without speaking English or Chinese. He found it terrifying and overwhelming due to his isolation. 

- He struggled with sharing space, eye contact, verbal communication and following instructions. He would hide under the piano for comfort.

- Despite forming a bond with his kind teacher and loving playing the piano, Peter was devastated when he found out he had failed kindergarten. This was a huge blow to his self-esteem after thinking he was succeeding. 

- The failure reinforced beliefs that he was stupid and a humiliation, as his mother told him. It heightened his feelings of having failed in the world, like his father.

So in summary, Peter suffered immense loneliness and isolation as a child that had lasting impacts on his social and language development, leading to difficulties in kindergarten and shame over perceived failure.

 Here is a summary:

- Peter missed many developmental milestones as a young child due to being isolated in the attic. This led to delays in his readiness for kindergarten and ability to interact socially with other children. 

- A mother's love and attachment in early childhood is essential for healthy development. Peter did not experience this direct love and attachment from his mother. 

- Around age 2, children normally go through a stage of separating their identity from their mother's and learning to assert independence. Peter did not have the opportunity to go through this stage.

- Playing with other children teaches social and behavioral skills like taking turns that are important for kindergarten. Peter had no experience with group play activities. 

- The development of "executive function" in the prefrontal cortex during the first 4 years helps children learn skills like attention, problem-solving, and adapting to social rules/norms. Peter missed out on these formative years.

- After repeating kindergarten, Peter's experience improved with a kind teacher. He discovered his talent for music by playing the classroom piano, which was a joyous moment that changed his perspective. 

- By age 9, Peter's family was living in poverty. His father was depressed and neglected his diabetes. Peter's mother was abusive towards both Peter and his father. She threw out and destroyed Peter's toy piano during an angry outburst.

 Here is a summary:

- Peter and his mentally ill father went to a mall, where the father stole a synthesizer from a store. They were stopped by police. 

- The police drove them home, sensing something was mentally wrong with the father. Peter's sister paid for the synthesizer. 

- When the mother arrived, she violently attacked and beat the father until he had a heart attack and died. Peter felt responsible.

- Peter's mother was a harsh, abusive woman who saw him as a burden and constantly criticized him. However, she was also hard-working and acquired multiple properties.

- Peter began therapy to address childhood trauma, abuse, depression, anxiety, depersonalization episodes, and impotence issues stemming from lack of attachment as a child. 

- The therapist aimed to help Peter build his self-esteem and sense of identity independent from his mother's negative views, in order to strengthen his "ego" and ability to cope with stressors without dissociating. This was the goal of their multi-year therapy process.

 Here is a summary:

- Peter met a woman named Melanie while playing a gig in Arkansas. They bonded over their shared love of music, especially the blues. 

- Peter was able to have natural conversations with Melanie, a breakthrough for him. They went on several dates but did not have sex. 

- Peter visited Melanie in Georgia and tried to apply the relationship skills practiced in therapy. They cuddled in bed but Peter felt detached from his body due to past trauma. 

- Therapy helped Peter recognize that suppressed childhood needs for comfort, protection and bonding led to his difficulties with intimacy. The famous Harlow monkey experiments especially resonated with Peter and helped him understand his experiences. 

- While progress was made, fully overcoming the effects of early attachment issues and trauma was proving a gradual process. Peter was gaining skills but challenges with intimacy persisted, highlighting how deeply formative early experiences can be.

 Here is a summary:

- Peter went to therapy to address issues with depersonalization and inability to form close relationships. In therapy, they focused on exploring his dreams and unconscious thoughts and feelings. 

- A traumatic event occurred when Peter's niece was badly burned in an accident. This shook Peter and his perspective on his mother. 

- They visited the burn ward where Peter's mother shockingly laughed at and mocked the injured children. This angered Peter and he confronted his mother.

- Peter's mother's past was gradually revealed. She was the daughter of a second wife/concubine in an opium den in Vietnam. As a child, she and other girls were subjected to abuse including being burned with cigarettes as part of the business. 

- This helped explain her troubling and detached behavior. She never learned healthy parenting since her own mother exploited and abused her. Money was her way of protecting herself after a traumatic childhood with no control or rights. 

- Learning this history provided important context for Peter and helped the therapist understand why his mother treated him the way she did as a result of her own traumatic upbringing and lack of a nurturing parent. It was a major breakthrough in Peter's therapy journey.

 Here is a summary:

- Peter had begun setting boundaries with his toxic mother and recognizing abusive behaviors. He started looking at how he was treated by others outside the family as well. 

- Peter was having issues with Donnie, the lead singer of their band. Donnie was demanding and entitled, believing the audience came only to see him. Peter confronted Donnie saying they would now make decisions like encores together, not just Donnie alone. 

- Donnie, who had been married for 19 years with two kids, often lied to his wife Amanda about girls on the road. He wanted Peter to cover for him and lie to Amanda too. 

- Peter refused, saying he wouldn't lie to Amanda if she asked. The AIDS crisis was ongoing and Peter didn't think Donnie was being careful enough. Peter told Donnie they were friends but his friendship had limits regarding lying or covering for his unfaithfulness. 

- This confrontation showed Peter was continuing to establish boundaries with others, learn from his experiences with his toxic mother, and stand up for himself rather than tolerate poor treatment or abusive behaviors.

 Here is a summary of the key events that were described:

- Peter draws a line with his former bandmate Donnie after witnessing Donnie try to hit Amanda. He demands to see the band's financial records and discovers Donnie had been stealing from him for years. 

- Peter leaves the band and forms his own successful group. Amanda also leaves Donnie and moves into one of Peter's mother's properties with her children. 

- Peter begins spending time with Amanda and her children, such as taking them to events and giving the daughter piano lessons. He acknowledges being attracted to Amanda.

- Peter and Amanda go to a concert together but it doesn't progress to anything romantic. Peter gets upset later when Amanda introduces him to someone simply as "the landlady's son."

- Amanda confides in Peter about past traumas. They share an emotionally intimate moment holding each other.

- During one of Amanda's child-free breaks, they grow closer emotionally but don't engage in a sexual encounter. They express caring feelings for each other.

- A few weeks later, Peter reports they had a sexual encounter, but he felt inadequate when Amanda commented on his lack of chest hair. The summary did not include lying to Amanda.

 Here is a summary:

- Peter came to therapy believing his mother locking him in an attic as a child was not wrong. Through therapy, he came to understand it was abuse. 

- Viewing films on maternal attachment helped him stop blaming himself and reduce episodes of depersonalization. Learning of his mother's abuse history made her less frightening.

- Over time, he learned to identify, value and express his feelings. This allowed him to have a healthy sexual relationship with Amanda. 

- Moving out of his mother's property with Amanda and her kids allowed their relationship to develop freely. 

- Peter's dreams indicated his ability to handle challenges independently, showing therapy was successful in helping him overcome the abuse. 

- Forgiveness was key to his recovery, unlike others who suffered similar abuse. He made peace with his mother as much as possible.

- 25 years later at a meeting, Peter was happily married and successful in his work with piano. He saw meaning in all his past suffering.

So in summary, through addressing the trauma of his childhood abuse, Peter was able to develop self-awareness, intimacy, independence and ultimately find fulfillment and meaning in his life. Forgiveness played a central role in his recovery process.

 Here is a summary:

- Danny came to the therapist's office through a former patient who owned a trucking company. Danny was one of his best long-haul drivers. 

- Danny's family was from far northern Manitoba and lived a nomadic lifestyle trapping furs. This was a stark contrast to the therapist's urban upbringing. 

- Two months prior, Danny's wife and young daughter were killed in a car accident. However, Danny did not seem to grieve or take time off work. 

- During therapy sessions, Danny was very quiet and avoided eye contact. The therapist realized standard psychotherapy approaches were culturally inappropriate for Danny. 

- Through contacting an Indigenous psychiatrist, Dr. Clare Brant, the therapist learned more about Indigenous cultural values like avoiding conflict and not interfering with others. 

- The therapist adapted his approach, explaining his role but also asking Danny for help. Danny slowly opened up more, admitting he did not experience pain, which was important for the therapist to understand. This was promising progress after four months of mostly silent sessions.

 Here is a summary:

- Danny was from a remote trapping family in northern Manitoba. He told his therapist stories from growing up on the traplines with his parents and sister. 

- Two government agents forcibly removed Danny and his sister from their home to take them to a residential school over 1,000 km away. This was a traumatic experience that his parents seemed powerless to prevent.

- At the school, Danny and the other Indigenous children had their hair cut, were stripped of their clothing and heritage, and given uniforms and numbers instead of names. Danny was separated from his sister.

- The children were taught that Indigenous culture was bad and they had to assimilate by becoming English-speaking Canadians. Danny struggled not knowing English and missing his family. 

- Over time, Danny shared more details of his childhood with the therapist in their weekly sessions. The therapist listened without judgement and tried to gain Danny's trust to help process his trauma from being taken to the residential school.

 Here is a summary of the key points:

- Danny attended a residential boarding school for Indigenous children where speaking Indigenous languages was banned and punished. He was severely beaten for saying "hello" to his sister in Cree. 

- Conditions at the school were abusive and neglectful. Death rates were extremely high due to disease, malnutrition and mistreatment. Danny witnessed a child in his dorm die but was too afraid to report it. 

- Danny excelled academically but felt embarrassed by praise, as the same people complimenting him were responsible for the abuse. 

- He enjoyed farming and husbandry tasks at the school, where a priest privately taught him techniques. However, the priest sexually abused Danny repeatedly over many years. 

- Another priest known for sexual abuse would call boys from their baseball game one by one to abuse them. Danny was repeatedly abused from ages 8-9 to his teens by multiple perpetrators at the school. 

- The discussions of Danny's trauma were one of the earliest accounts the therapist heard of widespread sexual abuse at residential schools, decades before it became more publicly known.

- Recounting these traumatic memories was very difficult for Danny, and at one point he abruptly left a therapy session, a sign of how deeply affected he remained.

 Here is a summary of the key points:

- Danny abruptly left therapy in the middle of a session, the first time a patient had done so. This left the therapist concerned he had failed in some way. 

- The therapist realized how much Danny's story and cultural differences fascinated him. He admired Danny's resilience in enduring so much trauma. 

- To understand Danny better, the therapist sought out Indigenous healers and attended smudging ceremonies. He learned Indigenous healing focuses on spiritual connection and harmony with nature, unlike Western psychotherapy.

- Danny eventually returned but acted like nothing happened. The therapist pressed him to explain why he left. Danny said "Indians don't argue." 

- The therapist pushed back, saying they each need to learn from the other. Danny then accused the therapist of coming on to him, like the priests had. 

- The therapist apologized for unintentionally triggering Danny. He explained triggers to Danny and that most abuse victims have them. 

- Danny had never heard the term "sexual abuse victim" but seemed to understand it applied to him. 

- Danny opened up about summers home becoming sadder as his parents descended into alcoholism after being forced to settle on a reserve. 

- He was deeply hurt when showing his father 4H medals led to mockery and laughing at his accomplishments. This was the last thing he shared with his family.

 Here is a summary:

- Dr. Brant, an Indigenous psychologist, criticizes the Indigenous custom of using teasing, shaming and ridicule instead of direct anger to discipline children. He argues this can erode children's self-esteem and cause issues like humiliation, withdrawal and social problems later in life. 

- In therapy, Danny opened up about his father for the first time. Dr. Brant got Danny to imagine what his father might have said without being drunk, and Danny gave a moving soliloquy expressing his father's pain at losing his culture, livelihood and dignity to colonization. This helped Danny understand his father.

- Danny also discussed his dead wife Berit, a nurse he met in the hospital. They married after she got pregnant, but he felt detached. Berit was more demonstrative while Danny preferred silent togetherness. Their parenting styles clashed - Berit was very stimulating while Danny felt she was "meddling". This contributed to them growing apart.  

- Danny felt Berit saw him as a neglectful parent because his style was more hands-off. He believes if not for Berit, he could have had a closer relationship with his quiet daughter Lillian who was more like him. Opening up about his family relationships was an important step in Danny's therapy process.

 Here is a summary:

- Danny began to open up more in therapy about defining his feelings and understanding what was his fault versus what wasn't regarding his past trauma. 

- He finally disclosed the details of the prolonged sexual abuse he endured, both from a priest who was otherwise kind to him and a Christian Brother who was more violent. 

- The abuse from the kind priest who was a father figure to him was more emotionally confusing and traumatic than the abuse from the openly violent Christian Brother. 

- Processing the abuse helped Danny realize he may have been able to hold his daughter on his lap if she was still alive, as that physical contact had previously been associated with unwanted sexual advances due to his abuse.

- He was less scarred by sexuality overall after discussing it but still feared real intimacy beyond occasional one-night stands after his wife passed away. 

- Danny started standing up for himself more, like telling his manager at work not to call him an insulting nickname, showing increased confidence and ability to set boundaries as therapy progressed.

 Here is a summary:

- Danny struggled to feel comfortable showing physical or emotional intimacy with his late wife. He felt awkward putting his arm around her and sometimes felt smothered. 

- He preferred keeping some distance, like when driving where he had his hands on the wheel and his family near but not too close. He also felt most comfortable during nightly phone calls from the road.

- Danny visited his wife and daughter's graves, trying to say things he wished he had when they were alive but felt too weak to. 

- The therapist encouraged Danny that he was in fact very strong for keeping his vow never to drink again and persevering through residential school abuse.

- Danny began to see himself in a more objective, positive light as he made emotional progress in therapy over three years. But reconnecting with his Indigenous culture and healing was an important next step.

 Here is a summary of the key points:

- Danny visits his father's reserve for the first time in decades. He is shocked by how his father has deteriorated physically and mentally due to alcoholism. 

- Danny's younger brothers who still live with their father are also alcoholics. They mock and insult Danny, seeing him as too "white."

- Danny realizes his father's home and life on the reserve have become unstructured and dysfunctional. This is in stark contrast to how his father used to thrive managing their family camp in the bush. 

- The cycle of trauma and abuse across generations is evident. Danny and his sister were abused in residential school. This devastated their parents and destroyed their ability to properly parent subsequent children. 

- Danny's brothers have grown up with alcoholic role models and see drinking and fighting as normal. They will likely perpetuate the dysfunctional parenting to their own children. 

- Returning home triggers deep depression in Danny as he fully processes his traumatic past for the first time. He considers suicide, worrying his therapist. Antidepressants help stabilize him.

- Danny realizes through this ordeal that he has avoided confronting and dealing with his trauma for decades, employing dissociation as a defense mechanism to remain functional but unfeeling. He must now begin to process and heal from the past.

 Here is a summary:

- Danny grew up experiencing trauma, abuse, neglect and extreme poverty in a residential school system that aimed to assimilate Indigenous children and destroy their culture and language. 

- As an adult, Danny showed remarkable resilience by overcoming alcoholism, avoiding repeating the cycle of abuse, and providing stability for his family through steady employment. 

- However, the therapist argues Danny still carries deep wounds that Western therapy can only address partially. To fully heal, the therapist believes Danny needs Indigenous healing practices that incorporate spiritual and cultural elements.

- The therapist educated themselves on Indigenous healing and now recommends Danny try group healing ceremonies. However, Danny is reluctant and fearful of groups due to his negative experiences in the residential school system. 

- The therapist insists group healing is important because the trauma Danny and many Indigenous people endured was collective - from the multi-generational impacts of colonization, cultural suppression and abuse within the residential school system. Only other Indigenous people who shared that collective experience can truly understand and help with the healing process.

 Here is a summary:

- The therapist encourages Danny, an Indigenous man, to reconnect with his cultural traditions as a way of healing from past trauma. Danny is resistant to the idea, saying he lives in the city now, not on the reserve where he's from. 

- The therapist suggests sweat lodges, drum circles and other cultural activities in the city. Danny remains skeptical but agrees to try some Cree language lessons. 

- At the Native Canadian Centre where he signs up for lessons, Danny meets Sasina, an Indigenous woman involved with programs there. They bond over their shared heritage and interest in reconnecting with their cultures.

- Danny begins spending more time at the centre for lessons and activities. He and Sasina go to talks together and Danny learns more about her Ojibwe background. They develop feelings for each other.

- The cultural reconnection helps Danny heal. He starts embracing his Indigenous identity more through traditional activities like hiking and hunting. Learning he has a connection to Sasina helps him feel comfortable in his heritage and not have to explain it.

So in summary, the therapist encourages Danny to reconnect with his culture as a way of healing, and through this Danny meets Sasina and begins healing his identity and past trauma.

 Here is a summary:

- Danny had completed therapy with the narrator after five years of working through the trauma of his experiences at residential school. Their last session marked the end of their therapeutic work together. 

- One trigger for Danny was people sitting on his lap, due to abuse by a Catholic priest as a child. In therapy, he worked on being able to communicate his boundaries about this. 

- Danny got involved in Indigenous healing practices like sweat lodges, pipe ceremonies, talking circles, and smudging. The narrator encouraged this cultural/spiritual element.

- Danny went on several cultural outings like powwows, hunting trips, and traditional activities. Being in nature and doing these things helped him reconnect to his Indigenous identity and ancestral teachings. 

- By the end of therapy, Danny was reclaiming his Indigenous identity and cultural knowledge. He showed newfound joy, confidence and social connections. 

- After their last session, Danny gifted the narrator an beautifully crafted and significant sweetgrass basket as a thank you. This showed how far their relationship of trust had come.

 Here is a summary:

- Alana was referred to the therapist by a colleague who previously treated Alana's partner Jane, who transitioned from male to female. 

- Alana showed extreme fear and anxiety during her initial session, standing plastered against the window. She had red, irritated hands.

- Alana described being raised by her abusive, alcoholic father Art after her mother left when she was young. Art was deemed more fit to parent despite serious issues.

- Alana experienced severe physical symptoms like gagging, dry heaving, and vomiting in response to certain triggers. This affected her work but she was able to leave when needed.

- Alana has a high IQ and near-photographic memory. She worked in the IT department of a law firm and prepared briefs, though was not a lawyer herself and was underpaid. Her expertise was in family law.

- The summary provides background on Alana's upbringing and issues but does not yet reveal specifics of the abuse she experienced. Her symptoms and fears indicate deep trauma in her past.

 Here is a summary:

- Alana presented herself as a lesbian based on her experiences of abuse from her father, Art, from ages 4-14. Art would regularly rape and abuse her. 

- Her triggers for vomiting included the smell of fish (due to Art telling her she smelled like a fish during abuse), light touch (how Art would approach her), chewing sounds (Art would bite her during abuse), and bathrooms (where Art did further undisclosed abuse). 

- She described faking orgasms during abuse to try to appease Art and prevent further violence. This was deeply traumatic for her.

- Art would also force her to have sex with his friends and charge them, treat her like a prostitute. He dressed her as the character from Taxi Driver that he was obsessed with.

- During abuse he would also give her drugs from a young age, including LSD regularly from age 6-14 but she did not experience long term effects. 

- One traumatic event was when on an acid trip, Art pushed her and her sister into a river where the sister nearly drowned until they were saved by one of Art's friends. 

- She realized at a young age that Art was "sick" but thought the problems were with her and her mother until then.

- Her strategies for survival included dissociating during abuse and complying to escape further harm. The abuse caused deep trauma but she was a survivor.

 Here is a summary:

- Alana was left by her father Art at her grandparents' house in Kitimat, BC for two years while he went to work in a mine in Ontario. 

- Alana's grandmother was as evil as her father Art. Both were psychopathic and cruel. The grandmother subject Alana and her sister Gretchen to regular enemas and said they had "ruined" their father's chances. 

- At her grandparents' house, Alana's vagina and anus were mutilated through "cleaning", requiring reconstructive surgery as an adult. She was also given birth control pills from age 8, with no questions asked. 

- Alana was exposed to the Jehovah's Witnesses church, where she learned sexuality was taboo and she may be excluded from God's kingdom due to her past abuse. This led to hallucinations that she had giant visible genitals. 

- Alana became largely catatonic, refusing school out of fear others would see her imagined genitals. The only kind act she recalled was her grandfather silently handing her the comic pages from the newspaper.

So in summary, Alana suffered extreme physical, sexual and psychological abuse at the hands of both her father and grandmother during this traumatic period spent at her grandparents' house.

 Here is a summary:

- The comic strip was called "Bringing Up Father", referring ironically to Alana having to "bring up" her father for years by taking care of him due to his alcoholism. 

- As a young child, Alana's grandmother made her sleep in the detached garage, giving her only a sleeping bag. She was very cold and would use the barbecue cover and car floor mats as blankets. 

- Alana's father Art raped and abused her throughout her childhood. Once when she was eight, he became disgusted by her genitals that had been mutilated by his own mother during another assault. 

- After this, Alana decided to commit suicide by exposing herself to extreme cold on the shore of a river. She hoped to die of hypothermia. However, she changed her mind, deciding to live for the sake of her sister Gretchen so she wouldn't have to suffer the same abuse. 

- Alana told her therapist that deciding to live was the most important moment of her life, likening it to Hamlet's dilemma of "to be or not to be." She endured daily torture and abuse to protect her sister, which required tremendous bravery and resilience.

 Here is a summary:

- Alana attended therapy with the psychologist seeking help with issues relating to her father Art. Art emotionally and psychologically abused Alana throughout her childhood. 

- During a therapy session, the psychologist gave Alana an IQ test without warning and she scored extremely highly, in the 99th percentile. However, this caused Alana distress as it reminded her of how her father would mock and belittle her.

- With the psychologist's encouragement, Alana asked her law firm for a raise. Initially her request was denied, but drawing on skills learned in therapy, she assertively defended her value and expertise, leading to a doubling of her salary and later a large bonus. 

- Alana shared that she hears a constant "tape" of her father's abusive comments in her head, undermining her confidence. The psychologist helps her understand this is a result of the psychological trauma from her childhood abuse. 

- Through therapy, Alana slowly began opening up more about the extensive physical, emotional and psychological abuse she endured from her father throughout her childhood, including gaslighting, confusing her about basic academic concepts, destroying her possessions, and killing her beloved cat in front of her.

- Alana abruptly left university due to fear of further humiliation, believing a professor praising her work was a trick, reminiscent of how her father would mock her. The psychologist helps her realize the professor's praise was genuine.

 Here is a summary:

- Alana talks about her father Art manipulating and gaslighting her through elaborate mind games like changing the rules when they played chess so she could never win. This left her questioning her own perceptions of reality. 

- She describes feeling like she was trapped in a cocoon of crazy threads spun by Art. She could see through the threads like a gauzy film but couldn't escape. 

- The therapist notes Art programmed Alana through constant negative reinforcement, essentially brainwashing her. Alana still hears tapes of the negative things Art told her.

- Alana opens up about sometimes having "episodes" where she goes blank and loses time, describing it as a catatonic or vegetative state. 

- She is too afraid to have episodes in court so works alone in her office instead of taking on leadership roles.

- Alana rarely talks about her mother, who disappeared when she was 3. She reveals her mother fought to regain visitation and they visited for a week each year in England starting when Alana was 9.

- However, the emotional connection was lacking as her mother couldn't handle hearing about the abuse Alana suffered. Alana felt like she had to pretend to be a happy, well-adjusted girl during the visits.

- The therapist pushes Alana to acknowledge her understandable anger towards her mother for abandoning her, even though she logically understands her mother's difficult situation.

 Here is a summary:

- Alana was hypervigilant and attuned to danger from living with her abusive father Art. This allowed her to detect a potentially violent situation at her law firm. 

- She endured years of abuse from Art, including being threatened with guns. She fantasized about shooting him but decided against it to avoid becoming like him. 

- At school, Alana withdrew and handed in blank pages due to Art telling her school was dangerous and she may lose her sister Gretchen if taken away. 

- No authorities intervened despite red flags like Alana's poor hygiene, absences, and infections from her injuries. 

- When Alana was 14, she was visiting a classmate's home where the mother noticed Alana was in pain and asked about it. Alana was too afraid to speak up. The mother called the police based on rumors she heard, leading to Alana's rescue from Art.

- Alana never reported the abuse earlier for fear of not being believed and being separated from Gretchen, leaving them with nowhere safe to go as foster homes were the only option. This was also during a time when incest and family abuse issues were rarely discussed publicly.

 Here is a summary:

- The police arrested Art, Alana and Gretchen's father, for possessing drugs, child pornography, and unregistered firearms at his filthy house. The girls were removed from his care.

- Gretchen was placed with a German family who owned a bakery. She enjoyed baking and eventually became a pastry chef. 

- Alana, as a teenager, wanted to be placed in a group home rather than a foster home so she wouldn't be controlled by another "loony." She lived in a group home near Gretchen until aging out of the system at 18.

- Alana struggled with lingering emotional damage from Art's abuse. This caused problems in her life, including having to leave her university program. 

- Alana had been in therapy with the reporter for two years. They discussed her progress in asserting herself as well as coming to terms with her mother. 

- As Alana continued therapy and maturing, she began rapidly progressing through childhood developmental stages that she missed due to her trauma, from infancy to adolescence. 

- Alana started showing new behaviors like temper tantrums, wanting to choose her own clothes, joking at work, and differentiating herself from others.

- Alana then disclosed to the reporter that she had sudden sexual encounters with a coworker, realizing she had desires and could experience intimacy, though this posed questions about her relationship with partner Jane.

 Here is a summary:

- Alana had recently gotten discharged from the hospital after a suicide attempt involving an alcohol and drug overdose. She had disappeared for 3 days. 

- Alana showed up at the therapist's office in a scowling mood, skipping the waiting room and acting rudely. 

- She was angry about Jane finding her after the suicide attempt and involving the therapist. She expressed wanting to get away from her long-term relationship with Jane.

- Alana spoke vulgarly and angrily, using a much sharper tone than usual. She said she was tired of Jane's kindness and wanted to be with a young woman instead. 

- She expressed anger that Jane wouldn't let her die from the overdose and that Jane was being controlling and smothering in the relationship. 

- The therapist noticed this was an entirely different personality than usual for Alana - more adolescent, rude, and indiscriminately vulgar. It sounded like something may have changed in her psychologically or physically.

 Here is a summary:

- The patient Alana had an angry confrontation during her previous therapy session, stomping out and slamming the door. This was unlike her usual polite demeanor. 

- The therapist noticed differences in this personality's voice, walking gait, and memory of the office location. They seemed like a different Alana. 

- This led the therapist to consider for the first time that Alana may have dissociative identity disorder (previously known as multiple personality disorder).

- The therapist researched the disorder extensively and consulted experts. They concluded Alana's history of prolonged trauma could have caused the fragmentation of her personality.

- The therapist carefully re-reviewed years of session notes and found a letter from Alana hinting at having "personalities" or "programs" but feeling she was still in control of them. 

- At their next session, the therapist confronted Alana about possibly having dissociative identity disorder. However, Alana was back to her usual self and could not account for missing memories. 

- The therapist remains uncertain of the diagnosis but believes Alana needs help processing her trauma history and moving forward in her life.

 Here is a summary of the key events and discussions:

- Alana is struggling to end her relationship with Jane, whom she no longer loves romantically but cares for as a friend. She feels trapped in the relationship. 

- Alana reveals to her therapist that she has alternate personalities - Chloé, Roger, and Amos - that emerged years ago to help her cope with and stand up to the abusive tapes of her father Art that play in her head constantly. 

- It's discovered that Chloé took over and acted cruelly during Alana's breakup with Jane, getting drunk and yelling at her. Chloé also surfaced during a previous therapy session.

- Alana tried to commit suicide after feeling she had nowhere to turn and was being cruel to Jane. 

- The therapist believes Alana suffers from dissociative identity disorder, where the alternate personalities represent missing traits. Chloé expresses anger, Roger insolence, and Amos protection.

- The goal will be to help Alana integrate the personalities by developing confidence, boundaries, and coping skills, so she's in control and they only emerge occasionally to fight the Art tapes, not take over fully. Progressing the therapy will be difficult given the severity of Alana's childhood trauma.

 Here is a summary:

- The therapist obtained Alana's hospital report about her recent suicide attempt, which outlined that she didn't cooperate with psychiatrists and refused antidepressants. 

- When discussing it, Alana was dismissive of the diagnosis and treatment plan. She felt better than ever and didn't want to take drugs. 

- The therapist pushed for Alana to discuss the suicide attempt in therapy to build coping strategies, while Alana just wanted to move on since the crisis passed. 

- They worked on techniques like establishing boundaries, as Alana had difficulty with this due to her abusive upbringing. They did roleplaying exercises to practice setting boundaries with her family.

- Over time, Alana got better at handling conflicts and expressing emotions/needs, like confronting her mother's unrealistic view of being a parent. Their therapy was a difficult journey as the therapist realized he should have been more vigilant given her past suicide attempt.

 Here is a summary:

- Alana had considered suicide but didn't tell her therapist, Gild, because she felt so ashamed of what she had done to her sister Jane and thought Gild would hate her. 

- Gild realized he missed signs that could have indicated Alana's potential dissociative identity disorder (DID), like periods of "catatonia" and changes in manner when discussing different situations/people.

- With therapy, Alana began feeling better able to dismiss the negative tapes played by her abusive father "Art" in her head. She socialized more in the LGBTQ community.

- Her wild sexual phase was brief and she found abstinence better for her mental health. Sex also triggered bad memories.

- Reading about Gild's happy childhood in his memoir made Alana cry, as it reminded her of one positive memory with her father looking at northern lights. 

- Inspired, Alana later called her father, who was cordial. This helped Alana feel less controlled by him.

- Alana made progress but still struggled sometimes. She focused on caring for her sister to find purpose.

- By the end of therapy, Alana felt ready to conclude it, proud of her progress. Gild was glad for but also sad to see her go.

- Years later, Alana shared she had unknowingly been competing against her deceased father in violent video games for years before he died.

 Here is a summary:

- Madeline Arlington was a 36-year-old antique dealer in Manhattan who grew up in Toronto with a disturbed mother, Charlotte, and inconsistent father, Duncan. 

- Duncan asked the therapist to treat Madeline after a brief session of his own six years prior. This led to an unintentional parental transference by the therapist onto Duncan.

- In the therapist's brief session with Duncan and his girlfriend Karen, they explained their backstory of nearly marrying as teenagers but marrying others instead. Karen had mental health issues and breakdowns. 

- Karen unleashed anger at Duncan for being cheap and not maintaining or updating his mansion. She admitted to destroying hundreds of his mother's antiques in a fit, which led to police involvement by Madeline.

- Therapy changed Madeline's life for the better by stopping her "seizures" and helping her understand triggers. She uses tapes of positive things said in therapy to combat intrusive thoughts from her abusive ex. 

- Madeline maintains strict boundaries but finds happiness pursuing hobbies of kickboxing and physics while living independently on the periphery of social situations. She says therapy was the best thing she ever did despite hating it.

 Here is a summary:

- Duncan Arlington calls Dr. Cathy Gildiner six years after their last session together, asking her to treat his daughter Madeline. He persuades Cathy to agree to 6 sessions by flattering her and offering to promote her books. 

- Madeline runs her own successful antiques business in a large loft space in Tribeca. The office is busy and chaotic, with employees urgently unpacking and sorting antiques. 

- Madeline keeps Cathy waiting 35 minutes past their appointment time before her assistant Vienna takes Cathy back to see her. Vienna warns Cathy that Madeline can be yell-y but not to abandon ship as they are all sinking.

So in summary, Duncan convinces Cathy to treat his daughter Madeline after years, and Madeline runs a busy antiques business out of her loft office in a chaotic manner, making Cathy wait a long time for their session.

 Here is a summary:

- Madeline is an businesswoman who runs an antiques business. She is anxious and suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), which has been worsening and affecting her work. 

- Her symptoms include obsessive thoughts that her staff will die in a plane crash, leading her to compulsively cancel flights and travel. This is crippling her business.

- She consults a therapist (the narrator) for help. They discuss a treatment plan involving both therapy and consulting an OCD specialist. 

- Madeline's father Duncan interrupts their session uninvited, causing a scene. However, Madeline is still able to continue her therapy.

- Madeline has a complex family history. Her mother Charlotte never wanted children but had Madeline to please Madeline's father and grandparents. 

- Charlotte was emotionally and physically abusive towards Madeline as a child, controlling her eating habits and putting her in difficult situations. This had long-lasting impacts on Madeline.

- Madeline is determined to get treatment to help manage her OCD and anxiety for the sake of her business and employees who rely on her.

 Here is a summary:

- Madeline recalled an embarrassing incident from her childhood where her mother publicly humiliated her at a restaurant by accusing her of stealing food from the table when she was just playing with her napkin. 

- After this incident, Madeline's father comforted her and encouraged her to confide in him. He seemed to think she was in trouble and suggested she spend more time with her grandmother. 

- Madeline's grandmother played an important supportive role, taking her out regularly and showing her love and kindness. This provided an escape from her controlling and abusive mother.

- Madeline's mother came from a background that was less proper than her husband's family. She associated with flashy and scandalous friends, and Madeline recalled walking in on her mother sitting intimately with their male interior decorator. 

- When confronted, Madeline's mother threatened to falsely accuse Madeline of inappropriate behavior with the gardener to get rid of him. She also blamed Madeline for the gardener bringing home a puppy. 

- The puppy, Fred, became very important to Madeline as the only one who defended and loved her unconditionally. She believed his presence literally "rescued" her.

- Madeline's father was terrified of confronting her mother directly, though he tried to comfort Madeline when he could. He seemed dominated and controlled by the mother.

 Here is a summary:

- Madeline has recently developed a fear of air travel that is impacting her business, as she won't let any employees fly to make deliveries. 

- Her assistant Vienna voiced concern to the therapist about how this is hurting the company. When Madeline overheard, she angrily told Vienna to leave.

- In therapy, Madeline admitted feeling afraid that if things go well, something bad will happen as punishment, since deep down she feels like a "monster" as her mother used to call her. 

- Madeline's mother Charlotte had trichotillomania, an impulse disorder where she compulsively pulled out and damaged her eyebrows. Madeline witnessed this behavior growing up.

- The therapist noticed Madeline's unusual, drawn-on eyebrows and suspected she may also have trichotillomania, but Madeline denied this was the case and claimed her brows were just a style choice. 

- The therapist decided not to confront Madeline directly about this issue, as gaining her trust was more important, and insights come when the patient discovers things for themselves rather than being told directly.

 Here is a summary:

- The therapist has been working with Madeline to help her deal with personal demons through an unconventional therapy approach focused on trust and her best interests.

- Madeline runs an appraisal company with many neurotic but talented Hungarian employees who are like a dysfunctional family. 

- Madeline opens up about her ex-husband Joey, whom she married to escape her narcissistic mother's influence, but he became lazy and disconnected from work. 

- She describes the trauma of discovering her mother seduced and had an affair with Madeline's high school boyfriend Barry, destroying that relationship and betraying her trust. 

- This reinforced Madeline's fear of her competitive, narcissistic mother, who then killed Madeline's dog after a confrontation, showing she was not safe from her mother's wrath. 

- Madeline sees parallels between hiring demanding but talented employees and recreating the family dynamic with her mother. Opening up about these past betrayals helps explain her trust issues and workaholic tendencies in therapy.

 Here is a summary:

- Madeline and her husband Joey were having relationship issues as their interests diverged. Joey refused to consider Madeline's interests or make her happy. 

- Madeline had an abusive mother who cared only about herself. Joey began treating Madeline the same way, disregarding her needs. 

- Madeline feared abandonment due to her neglectful upbringing. Her mother would frequently leave her alone as a child for long periods of time, including a 6 week trip abroad when Madeline was 11-12 years old. 

- Madeline remained in the unhappy marriage out of fear of being abandoned, like she was by her mother as a child. She is receiving therapy to work through these childhood issues. 

- Her employee Vienna interrupts a therapy session to warn about financial troubles at Madeline's company, showing other ongoing stresses in Madeline's life she is working to address.

 Here is a summary:

- Madeline realizes she subconsciously believed she was a "monster" and that monsters don't deserve happiness, explaining her fear that good things in her life would be taken away. 

- She sees that she married a man similar to her cruel mother, narcissistic and indifferent to her needs, just like her marriage to Joey. 

- Recalling her childhood feelings of abandonment when left alone helps explain why she stayed in difficult relationships.

- Three key revelations have emerged: 1) her belief that she is a monster, 2) marrying a version of her mother, and 3) her history of abandonment issues. 

- The therapist wants to help Madeline integrate these insights into a new narrative that addresses the root cause of her destructive patterns and debilitating symptoms related to her traumatic childhood and mother's influence. Facing the real issues could allow meaningful change, rather than just managing symptoms indefinitely.

 Here is a summary:

- Madeline was afraid to visit her mother Charlotte in Florida due to past negative experiences. Her mother had neglected to pick her up from the airport before and was generally emotionally unavailable. 

- Charlotte left Madeline's father Duncan for another man, Jack, when Madeline was 14. Jack was richer but sleazy. Charlotte and Jack are now caring for aging Jack as his health declines.

- When they were still together, Charlotte used Madeline as part of her affairs with Jack, pretending Madeline wanted to play with Jack's kids to spend time together. This was embarrassing for Madeline. 

- Despite her mother's mistreatment, Madeline continues trying to please Charlotte and get her approval. The counselor suggests exploring why through free association, and Madeline realizes she just wanted her mother's love but could never get it no matter what she did. 

- Even though Charlotte was a neglectful mother, Madeline's instinct was still to seek her love, like infant animals seeking care from their parents. Stories are shared about how important early bonding and experiences with caregivers are for development.

 Here is a summary:

- Madeline expressed increased anxiety about plane crashes affecting her business. I recommended either letting employees fly and managing anxiety, taking medication, or continuing therapy. 

- Madeline dismissed medication, saying she didn't want to be like her mother who took many medications and drank alcohol. 

- She revealed having had four separate cancers between ages 21-35 - breast, thyroid, endometrial, and now melanoma. 

- Madeline believes her immune system was compromised as a child, leaving her vulnerable to unrelated cancers. 

- When asked if she thought the cancers were punishment for being a "monster," she responded that her mother told her the world would find out and she'd have an awful life. 

- Her mother Charlotte showed little care or support during Madeline's first cancer at age 21. Madeline's relationship with her father improved when Charlotte left when Madeline was a teenager.

The summary highlights Madeline's severe health issues and ongoing anxiety, as well as the revealed lack of support from her mother during her cancer treatments. It also notes Madeline's belief that her immune system was damaged from childhood abuse, leaving her susceptible to multiple cancers.

 Here is a summary:

- Madeline had been working for her antiques company non-stop for over two years, working every day and weekend. Her assistant Vienna was worried about her health. 

- Madeline's only confidant had been Anton, an immigrant from Russia who worked with her assessing artifacts. He had been loyal to her through personal and business struggles. 

- Madeline revealed that Anton often said goodnight to her in Russian, which the therapist later discovered translated to "Goodnight, my cherished one." However, Madeline had not realized the meaning.

- When confronted about possibly having feelings for Anton, Madeline had a meltdown. She shredded papers and told the assistant to tell the therapist that therapy was over permanently. 

- The therapist realized they had pushed Madeline too fast by overinterpreting her relationship with Anton and relationship fears, triggering her obsessive thought patterns from childhood trauma. Anton was the only stable relationship in her life.

So in summary, the therapist pushed Madeline too far by confronting her about Anton before she was ready, causing her to end therapy due to resurfaced emotional trauma from her past.

 Here is a summary:

- Madeline was terrified of plane crashes and falling in love with Anton, as love meant abandonment, disappointment and betrayal based on her family experiences. 

- Her mother was cruel to her and said it was because she loved her. Her father chose two narcissistic partners over her welfare.

- She fought hard to survive life-threatening illnesses alone. Love was too great a risk as she didn't feel deserving of it.

- As a therapist, the author rushed Madeline's interpretation and insights, causing psychological distress ("the bends"). He had a countertransference to Madeline's situation due to similarities with his own upbringing.

- The author met with his mentor Dr. Milch to discuss the case. Dr. Milch pointed out many flaws and rule-breakings in how the author handled Duncan and Madeline, suggesting it revealed unresolved issues with the author's own father. The author's father had been successful but later embarrassed the family and abandoned the author financially. This countertransference blinded the author to fully explore Duncan's behaviors and hold him accountable.

 Here is a summary:

- The patient argues that her father's abandonment of the family due to a brain tumor when she was a teenager wasn't his fault. However, Dr. Milch points out that the unconscious mind doesn't care about facts - it only experiences emotions like abandonment. 

- Dr. Milch gets the patient to realize that her bonding with Duncan represented her desire to recreate the time when her father was successful before his illness. She wanted to freeze time and be the adored daughter of a loving father. 

- Through this therapy and writing the book, the patient also realizes she unintentionally chose three women to write about who were all mostly raised by their fathers, similar to her own upbringing. This shows how the unconscious can influence a therapist's choices without realizing it. 

- The session shows how therapy helped the patient overcome issues from her past that she couldn't on her own, and the importance of not becoming complacent as an experienced therapist. Self-awareness and addressing the unconscious is important.

 Here is a summary:

- Madeline overcame her struggles with mental health issues and workaholism over the course of her therapy with the author, which spanned more than 4 years. 

- Significant changes happened in Madeline's life as her mental health improved - she began taking Sundays off work, traveling with her partner Anton, forgiving her father, etc. 

- The biggest hurdle was flying in a plane with Anton, showing she had overcome her trauma and ability to be intimate. 

- By the end of therapy, Madeline was in a much better place mentally, though still prone to regressions during times of stress. The author felt proud of their work together. 

- Madeline is seen as a psychological hero for overcoming the abuse and "brainwashing" she endured from her mentally ill mother as a child, which had severely impacted her mental health and ability to have relationships.

- Years later, the author catches up with Madeline and learns she remained happily with Anton, had no cancer returns, and continued improving her relationships with her father and others. She had learned to protect herself from her manipulative mother.

 Here's a summary of ingenuity and grace:

Ingenuity refers to being clever, original, and inventive. It's about coming up with innovative solutions to problems through creative insight and resourcefulness. Grace on the other hand suggests elegance, poise, and charm. It refers to a natural attractiveness in physical or intellectual qualities. 

While ingenuity deals more with intellect and problem-solving abilities, grace focuses on aesthetic appeal, polite manners, and seemingly effortless performance. Ingenuity requires thinking "outside the box" and approaching challenges unconventionally. Grace involves composure, balance, and refinement whether in physical movement, artistic expression, or interpersonal interaction.

Together, ingenuity and grace signify using one's intelligence and creativity in a manner that is also tasteful, tactful, and pleasant rather than jarring or inelegant. It's about achieving results innovatively but with a sense of flair, style and consideration for others. The combination captures a blend of practical strategy and esthetic quality, of solving puzzles artistically as well as analytically.
