 Here are the key reasons to become an Amazon affiliate:

- It's free to join the Amazon Associates program. There are no fees to sign up or costs associated with promoting Amazon products.

- Amazon has a huge catalog of millions of products across dozens of categories. This gives affiliates lots of options to promote products that match their niche/audience. 

- Amazon is a very well-known and trusted brand. Visitors are already familiar with Amazon and comfortable making purchases on the site. This lowers barriers to conversions.

- The commission rates are reasonable, generally 4-10%. And affiliates earn commissions on any products purchased by their referral links in the next 24 hours, not just the promoted item.

- Traffic and sales on Amazon are very high, providing ample opportunity for affiliates to earn commissions. Holiday seasons in particular see a big spike.

- Promoting bestsellers and trending products can earn good commissions with less effort since the interest is already there. 

- It's easy to integrate affiliate links into blogs, websites, emails and social media to promote products. The program provides tracking and reporting of earnings.

- Over time, consistent affiliate efforts can build a passive revenue stream from the long-tail of Amazon sales conversions.

So in summary, the Amazon Associates program removes financial and access barriers for affiliates while providing a trusted marketplace where sales and commissions can be achieved.
