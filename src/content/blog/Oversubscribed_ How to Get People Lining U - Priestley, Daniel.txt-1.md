- The book explains the phenomenon of being "oversubscribed", which is when demand vastly outstrips supply for a product/brand to the point where there are many more buyers than sellers/capacity allows. 

- The author's company runs large business events around the world that are premium priced yet oversubscribed, selling out venues like theaters despite most business events struggling to get 100 people. 

- For example, the author had to issue an email offering to buy back already sold tickets for double the price when an event in Sydney sold over capacity of 700 people, even though the company had no staff in Sydney at the time. 

- Similarly, events in other cities like Melbourne, London and Florida also sold out with waiting lists forming, showing this was no accident but strategically orchestrated. 

- The book aims to explain how to achieve this state of being oversubscribed through principles and strategies for connecting supply and demand in a way that drives intense demand.

 Here are the key points summarized from the passage:

- The author launched a boutique marketing company at age 22 that generated over $1 million in revenue and $300,000 cash within 12 months. 

- By age 25, the company had generated over $10 million in sales, making the author financially successful at a young age.

- At age 25, the author and business partners moved to London and launched a new business there that also achieved millions in sales within 12 months.

- At age 29, the author wrote their first book that reached #1 on the Amazon business books list by utilizing the ideas in the book. 

- The author has raised millions in investment capital for businesses and helped charities raise hundreds of thousands within a short time through their promotional abilities.

- The passage introduces that the book will share ideas on how to make a product or service "oversubscribed" through proven principles and stories from the author's experiences building successful companies from a young age.

 Here is a summary of the key points about being oversubscribed and its relationship to trading strategy and profits:

- At its core, the price of any asset or good is determined by the balance of supply and demand - whether there are more buyers or sellers. Having more buyers than sellers leads to higher prices.

- Businesses can only make a sustained profit if demand consistently outstrips supply, creating a state of being "oversubscribed". This generates tension that allows prices and margins to remain high. 

- Examples of oversubscribed businesses include Ferrari, where limited supply means some prospective buyers always miss out, and WhatsApp's acquisition valuation soaring due to competitive bidding between Facebook and Google.

- When supply meets or exceeds demand, as in a saturated market, prices fall and businesses may suffer losses trying to generate sales. Uber struggles to be profitable due to its model enabling abundant supply.

- Traders can exploit imbalances in supply and demand at any given time to generate profitable trades. Understanding when an asset is over- or undersubscribed guides strategic trading decisions.

- Maintaining oversubscription requires limiting supply enough that some buyers are disappointed without losing interest altogether. This rewards customers who do secure the product or service.

 

- Creating your own market involves separating yourself from the larger industry/market forces and developing a dedicated group of loyal customers. This insulates you from competition and allows you to charge higher prices. 

- You don't need a massive customer base - even a few thousand loyal customers can be enough to become oversubscribed and profitable. 

- Successful people like celebrities and entrepreneurs have cultivated their own markets through building loyal fan bases on social media. 

- Life coach Rich Litvin caters exclusively to elite clients, charging $80k/year by providing a high level of dedicated service. He only works with 8 clients at a time. 

- By saying no to most people and promoting an exclusive image, Rich was able to become oversubscribed and command high prices, earning far more than the average life coach. Developing your own niche market allows you to earn significantly more.

 

- Rich began campaigning for soft signals of interest from people through sharing specialised content like stories, insights and philosophies over 60 days. This engaged around 1,000 people. 

- He then launched an exclusive group product called 4PC which was capped at 60 members. With over 1,000 engaged from the campaign, the launch was very successful and generated over $1 million in sales. 

- The group remains exclusive and desirable by limiting membership, and includes high-achieving individuals from various backgrounds. 

- The key is finding your market - the people who truly value what you do and can afford it. You understand their needs better than they do. You focus your energy on these people over time.

- By spending sufficient time, having interactions, and connecting in multiple locations, you can build strong bonds and emotional connections with people even if they've never met you. This is the formula to carve out your own market at scale.

- To stand out in a noisy marketplace, you must lay the foundations for people to genuinely get to know, like, and trust you, rather than interrupting them with promotions. Seeing a familiar, trusted face emerges from the crowd.

- Your content should be "binge-ready" so potential customers can deeply research and learn about you by consuming various online materials for an extended period of time, in order to truly understand and care about your offering.

 

- Oversubscribed businesses don't try to sell products to the mass market right away. They focus on those who have expressed interest first. 

- Samsung rushed to release its Gear smartwatch before Apple's new watch was announced. They built many watches but had high return rates and needed discounts since the market wasn't ready.

- Apple took more time. It released information slowly, raised awareness through fashion icons, and partnered with luxury brands to position the Apple Watch as high-end. It limited initial supply and required appointments to try watches in stores. This helped them balance demand and supply better.

- Businesses should signal their intentions to potential customers and get their feedback before trying to make direct sales. Asking for small "signals" of interest helps gauge demand instead of rushing a sale. Taking time to educate the market leads to better results than expecting immediate purchases.

 

- There are typically four big players that dominate different market positions in many industries: innovation, relationships, convenience, and price. Brands specialize in dominating one position. 

- Innovation involves creating something new the market wants. Relationships focus on owning customer relationships through influence, brand recognition, and contracts. Convenience reduces friction/effort for customers. Price involves lowering costs through investment, refinement, and systemization to offer lower prices while maintaining margins.

- Businesses should choose one main market position to focus on dominating. Innovation may be through new products, systems, or branding. Relationships are built through influence, branding, and contracts. Convenience reduces distribution effort, informs customers, and automates processes. Price is reduced through strategic investments, efficiency, and technology over people. Establishing which position the business excels at helps customers keep coming back.

 

People don't always buy products even when they feel positively about them and think they would be useful. Buying behavior is stimulated by the environment and conditions surrounding the purchase. Marketers can deliberately create these conditions to influence when and how people buy. 

The story provides an example of how the organizers of a workshop strategically created conditions of high demand and limited supply to stimulate early ticket sales. They showed there was already strong interest, but availability would be limited. This created a sense of urgency that got over 175 people interested within two days, and all tickets sold out over a week in advance. 

The key lessons are that marketers can deliberately set their own rules for how and when people buy, rather than passively waiting for sales. Creating the right conditions, like signaling high demand and constrained supply, can encourage herd-like stampeding toward the purchase. It's more effective than trying to convince individual buyers one by one.

 

- The passage advocates setting yourself apart from competitors by being different, unique, and setting your own rules rather than conforming to industry norms. 

- It provides the example of celebrity chef Pete Evans, who has built a loyal following by sticking firmly to his philosophy about healthy, whole food and spreading that message through his cooking and media appearances. Some people strongly agree with his philosophy while others strongly disagree, but he focuses on serving his supporters rather than trying to please everyone.

- Adopting a polarizing but clearly defined philosophy or point of view, like Evans has done, can help differentiate a business and attract a loyal following, even if it also generates some detractors. Trying to be bland and inoffensive risks pleasing no one. Setting one's own rules rather than conforming can lead to success.

 

- The passage discusses the importance of developing and sharing your own personal philosophy or set of strongly held beliefs and values, rather than just focusing on features and benefits of your products/services. 

- Having a clear philosophy allows you to connect more deeply with customers who resonate with your beliefs and values. It helps you stand out from competitors and build loyalty. 

- Examples are given of influential figures like environmental activist Paul Watson and investors like Warren Buffett who are renowned for their strong, clearly articulated philosophies. 

- The passage encourages businesses to be open about constraints and bottlenecks instead of pretending they can meet all demand. Saying no to some customers can signal high demand and exclusivity. 

- Businesses that are truly "oversubscribed" have no problem turning customers away if they don't meet the company's high standards or philosophy. Only the best routinely use their power to say no.

 

- The passage discusses how an oversubscribed business operates differently than one that is constantly trying to take on more clients and remain busy. 

- An oversubscribed business will tune into the little voice that says a potential client may not be the right fit, rather than taking them on just to pay the bills. They understand that saying no to the wrong clients creates space for perfect, ideal clients.

- Rather than viewing each client in isolation and trying to maximize revenue from each, an oversubscribed business focuses on curating the best overall client portfolio. This allows them to provide the best experience and achieve the best long-term outcomes.

- The key point is that an oversubscribed business has the luxury of being selective about clients because their services are in high demand. They can afford to turn away less than ideal clients in order to focus on their most important work.

 

- The passage discusses business owners who are annoyed that their business isn't simple and they expect to get paid directly for the value they create. 

- However, the author argues that today's successful businesses are complex ecosystems that provide value in many ways, not just direct payment for a single service. 

- To be highly rewarded, a business needs to build an entire high-performing ecosystem that delivers value through a variety of channels, not just expect payment for individual services. 

- The old model of simply delivering value and getting paid does not work in today's complex business environment. Success requires building an entire ecosystem and orchestrating many moving parts.

So in summary, the author argues against the mindset of expecting direct payment only for individual services. Today, businesses must create complex, high-functioning ecosystems to deliver value in multiple ways in order to achieve high rewards.

 

- Politicians have always used the leading marketing/communication channels of their time to reach voters, from FDR's radio "fireside chats" to Kennedy harnessing the power of television debates. 

- Obama was the first to embrace social media campaigning, gaining followers and support through platforms like Facebook, Twitter, YouTube. This ushered in a new era where social media became the dominant marketing arena.

- Trump shocked the world by using highly targeted digital marketing based on vast amounts of consumer data. His campaign mined information to deliver uniquely tailored ads to sway specific voter groups. 

- His success with a data-driven approach signaled a major shift, as big brands will now focus more on gathering consumer data and precision-targeting customized messages based on individual profiles and interests. Politicians and marketers must meet people where they currently engage online and address them through personalized, relevant communications.

 

- Hyper-targeted marketing uses extensive personal data to hyper-personalize each person's marketing experience based on their interests, behaviors, demographics and more. This allows ads, content and messages to be extremely tailored to individuals. 

- As data collection increases through things like smart devices, AI and biometrics, hyper-targeting will get more detailed in understanding people. Marketers will be able to speak directly to individuals in very personalized ways.

- For small businesses to keep up, they need to extensively collect customer data through surveys, quizzes, etc. and use that data to run highly targeted campaigns. More data allows marketing to be more effective with less spending. 

- When marketers understand customers deeply through data, they can meet them "where they are" by addressing their specific needs and pain points. This level of personalization can help build strong brand love and loyalty over time.

 

- The problem is often not clear enough or compelling enough to motivate people to seek the proposed solution. For a solution to gain attention and excitement, the problem must be presented in a big, bright, clear way. 

- Similarly, the solution can't be piecemeal - it must be elegant, complete and deliver everything needed to fully achieve the desired outcome or result. People don't want partial solutions. 

- By making the problem and solution compelling, it can captivate attention and excitement. But the solution delivery is also important - it must be able to fully realize the future or outcome being sold. 

- Many businesses underdeliver by only offering parts or components of a solution, rather than a complete packaged solution. This leaves people disappointed and the problem still not fully addressed. 

- To really motivate and attract people, the contrast must be clear between the current problem-filled state and the better future or result that the solution enables when implemented completely.

 

- Google has become very influential in determining people's reputations. A quick search can shape how others perceive someone, for better or for worse. 

- Negative search results, like reviews warning about a "scam artist" or "fraud", can damage impressions and businesses dealings, even if untrue. The author had to end a promising meeting due to unsettled feelings from online warnings. 

- Reputations online last a long time. Mistakes from years ago could still impact opportunities today if easily searchable. Conversely, positive reviews and testimonials also provide lasting benefits.

- It's important to proactively manage one's online presence and reputation. Both negative and positive content about a person persists indefinitely, so guarding one's image is important for professional and business success. As the saying goes, in the digital age you are who Google says you are.

So in summary, the passage discusses how crucial online reputation has become, as Google searches profoundly shape first impressions and ongoing perceptions in both negative and positive ways. Managing one's digital footprint is important.

 

- Businesses should think of themselves as "campaign-driven enterprises" rather than just businesses. This mindset focuses on running strategic campaigns rather than acquiring customers one by one. 

- The method outlines planning the year around three types of campaigns:

1. Weekly micro-campaigns - Generate leads and sales presentations weekly to achieve revenue goals. Examples given include weekly lunch/learn sessions.

2. Quarterly spotlight campaigns - Special promotions each quarter to put the business in the spotlight. Examples given include seminars hosted with partner brands. 

3. Annual big message campaign - Share high-level, interesting content year-round to position the business as an industry leader. Examples given include filming workshops/interviews for content marketing.

- The weekly campaigns create a consistent baseline of sales. The quarterly campaigns generate buzz and sales opportunities. The annual campaign keeps the business relevant throughout the year. 

- Prospects can engage with the business by interacting with any of the three campaign types. This coordinated approach is meant to drive faster growth than acquiring customers individually.

 

The passage discusses creating oversubscribed campaigns for a business by planning regular weekly marketing campaigns and quarterly spotlight campaigns. It recommends finding the right balance between generating most revenue through consistent weekly campaigns versus big quarterly events. 

Some key steps discussed are:

1) Plan your annual revenue target and break it up into realistic weekly and quarterly goals. 

2) Follow six phases for successful campaigns - planning, build up, release/generate interest, sales follow up, delivery, celebrate outcomes. 

3) Examples are given of potential weekly marketing campaigns like weekly info sessions, classes, membership trials. 

4) Quarterly spotlight campaigns could include special events, workshops, gala dinners to further engage the market.

5) The goal is to generate interest through a variety of touchpoints and ultimately have more demand than available supply/capacity to run an effective oversubscribed campaign. Regular testing and refinement of the approach is recommended.

 

The passage discusses finding the perfect market or target client for your business in order to become oversubscribed. It emphasizes that the ideal market will 1) highly value your product or service, 2) have the capacity to pay for it, and 3) be a group you want to serve. Having all three of these factors is necessary for success. 

It provides examples, like a high-end furniture maker who targets millionaires and billionaires, finding the right balance. Whereas a yoga instructor may struggle if her pricing is too high for her local market. 

The key is not just finding target clients, but also "aspirational" clients - those who love your offering, can afford it, and bring new customers. Figuring out who meets all these criteria is an important part of planning an effective marketing campaign. The activities prompt reflection on who specifically makes up one's ideal market.

 

An aspirational customer is someone that a business wants as a long-term client even if they cannot currently afford the full offering. By providing lower-cost introductory products, a business can generate customers and identify which ones have the greatest potential to become high-value clients over time. 

The key difference between a customer and a client is that a customer completes a one-time transaction while a client engages in an ongoing relationship where they continue purchasing. Generating customers is important for trial and growth, but the goal should be converting good customers into delighted clients who will regularly buy. 

Planning campaigns well in advance, such as having quarterly promotions, can help a business consistently delight customers and stay oversubscribed by maintaining demand above its fulfillment capacity. The capacity is the maximum number of delighted clients a business can support. Setting weekly and campaign targets aligned with this capacity allows for sustainable growth.

 Here are the key points about campaign needs summarized from the text:

- Campaigns need enough time to build momentum before the peak period. Having short campaigns won't allow enough energy to be built up.

- Break down annual client goals into weekly and quarterly goals to make the targets feel more achievable. 

- Each campaign needs a theme. Common themes include seasonal events, promotions, new products, or special events. But standing out requires themes relating to a bigger purpose or problem. 

- Important to have a timeline that schedules all communications, events, milestones, meetings, shipping dates, and post-campaign activities. 

- The timeline helps identify resources needed like emails, videos, social media assets, technology, and personnel. 

- Setting campaign themes, client goals, and timelines helps plan the year of campaigns in advance to reach the target of becoming oversubscribed.

 

The passage discusses how signalling is important for businesses to build interest and demand before asking for commitments like sales or subscriptions. 

It uses the example of the Glastonbury Music Festival, which artfully signals to potential attendees well in advance about ticket availability, sales dates, and refund policies. This builds anticipation and ensures tickets sell out quickly. 

The key aspects of signalling discussed are:

- Signalling intentions in advance so the market can prepare 
- Collecting signals of interest from the market before the commitment or sale
- Using signals to better understand different levels of interest beyond a simple yes/no to a purchase
- Emphasizing signals over direct sales pitches initially
- Common signalling techniques include hustling, joint ventures, advertising, referrals, and using existing customer data
- Mobile and social media are important platforms for initial signalling interactions given how many consume media on phones

In summary, it advocates that businesses should signal to their market first before asking for commitments, in order to build demand and ensure products or services are oversubscribed when it's time to deliver or sell.

 

The passage discusses how building trust and rapport is crucial in the build-up phase of a marketing campaign. It argues that people need about 7 hours, 11 interactions, or experiences across 4 locations/sources to make a significant decision after their interest has been piqued. 

During this build-up phase, businesses should focus on educating and entertaining potential customers through content like videos, blogs, reports, events etc. Entertainment can build connection while education builds understanding. The ideal ratio is 80% education mixed with 20% entertainment. 

The "7-11-4 rule" means capturing people's interest over 7 hours, across 11 interactions and 4 locations/sources. Digital interactions like social media count as they trigger similar brain responses as real interactions. Celebrities are effective endorsers because of existing 7-hour relationships from media exposure. Content like books can also scale relationships. Google's "zero moments of truth" refers to various data points needed to build trust during decision making. 

The passage advises maximizing ways to connect with interested potential customers during the build-up phase to clock up the needed 7 hours through a mix of education and entertainment content.

 

- The passage advocates using digital content and interactions across social media channels to educate and engage potential customers. Some suggestions are having 7 hours of available digital content and preparing at least 11 interactions across 4 social media channels. 

- It discusses using "products-for-prospects" like ebooks, podcasts, software downloads, events etc. to attract prospects and gather their information before selling the core product or service. This allows businesses to build an audience and learn more about customers' needs. 

- It emphasizes the importance of "naming your terms" i.e. setting expectations around customer qualifications, volume of customers served, pricing and partnership terms. This signals that demand outstrips supply and reassures customers of quality standards. 

- It advises against slowing marketing and demand generation efforts even after becoming oversubscribed, as this can cause interest to wane over time. Ongoing promotion is suggested to maintain a backlog of demand. 

- The key takeaway is that digital content, products-for-prospects and clear communication of terms can help attract prospects and signal that demand exceeds capacity, positioning the business as a desirable option for customers. Maintaining promotional efforts is important to sustain this oversubscribed status over the long run.

 

- To successfully market a product or service, it's important to measure both the quantity and quality of customer interest or "signaled interest". This includes things like downloads, event registrations, surveys completed, etc. 

- Higher quality signals involve more time or money invested by the customer, like paying for an event. Lower quality signals are things like downloading a free report. 

- An entrepreneur needs to track signaled interest from various sources on a central scoreboard to know if they have sufficient demand. 

- As a guideline, being "oversubscribed" means having 5x the number of high-quality signals, 10x warm signals, or 100x low-quality signals compared to capacity. 

- Creating transparency by sharing interest levels with potential customers can generate a sense of urgency and boost demand. Companies like Apple use media coverage to signal high interest in new products before they launch. 

- The key is to market for signals of interest initially, rather than direct sales, to build up demand and tension before fulfilling orders.

 

- Maintaining demand that exceeds supply, or being "oversubscribed", creates energy and urgency for potential customers. It makes people want to understand why others are lining up and join the line themselves.

- Staged releases, special/limited editions, and time limits or price increases are techniques to manage energy and keep supply/demand unbalanced. This maintains tension and urgency for customers to take action. 

- Staged releases involve releasing capacity in smaller chunks over multiple stages, like the Monty Python show added 9 more dates after initial tickets sold out. 

- Special/limited editions break capacity into variations targeted at subgroups, like The Beatles releasing many compilation albums targeted at fans of certain types of songs.

- Time limits and price increases create a sense of urgency, like the Monty Python tickets that sold out in under a minute initially and the additional shows being announced with a warning to act fast. 

- These techniques are planned upfront to maintain high energy and demand rather than used opportunistically mid-campaign. They help maximize the energy built through signaling interest to a large audience.

 

- Follow up sales is critical to maximizing the results of a marketing campaign. Most of the financial benefits come from sales conversations, not just initial interest. 

- Sales conversations are scripted interactions focused on the sale, while "chit-chat" avoids directly asking for the business. Major companies still conduct sales training and conversations.

- Developing a regular rhythm and cadence to sales activities like leads, appointments, presentations and final sales (LAPS) is important for the sales team to stay optimized. Weekly and quarterly LAPS targets help measure performance. 

- Understanding the typical LAPS ratios (e.g. one sale for every 10 leads) helps ensure goals are on track. If not, it identifies where improvements can be made in the sales process. Regular sales meetings also help ramp up effectiveness over time.

In summary, proactively following up on leads with scripted sales conversations is critical to maximize revenue from a marketing campaign, and developing regular sales rhythms and measurements helps optimize the sales process.

 

- The weekly sales targets are: 100 leads, 20 appointments, 16 presentations and 4 sales. 

- The quarterly campaign goals are: 600 leads, 120 appointments, 100 presentations and 25 sales.

- If these targets are annualized:
   - The weekly targets would result in 200 sales per year
   - The quarterly campaign goals would result in 100 sales per year

- So the total annual sales projected from both the weekly work and quarterly campaigns is 200 + 100 = 300 sales per year.

The target breakdown provides a framework to plan sales activity on both a weekly and quarterly basis to achieve the annual sales goal. Regular sales conversations and follow up are important to meeting the targets outlined for leads, appointments, presentations and final sales.

 Here is a summary of the key points in the passage:

- Delivering in a remarkably positive way is the most important step for a business to build loyalty and trust. Remarkable delivery reduces marketing costs to zero as satisfied customers will promote the business through word-of-mouth. 

- Businesses should aim to leave customers with an "up energy" feeling of delight or unexpected positive experiences, rather than just satisfying expectations. Doing unexpected good things keeps customers talking positively.

- It's important to underpromise and overdeliver. Only communicate 70% of what you intend to do so the actual delivery exceeds expectations. 

- When oversubscribed with demand, businesses should stick to the prices and capacity numbers they stated initially rather than opportunistically increasing them. Exceeding promised capacity risks letting customers down. 

- It's better to turn some customers away while maintaining remarkable delivery standards, trusting they will return or recommend the business due to its popularity and trustworthiness in keeping its word. Oversubscribing sets a business up to fail to deliver for all its customers.

 

- Businesses should stick to their pricing plans and capacity limits rather than giving in to quick sales, otherwise customers will think deals are always available and the business loses credibility. 

- Every turned away customer is potential advertising as they will likely share their experience of not being able to purchase. This builds demand over time.

- All businesses are technology businesses now. Automation and tools are needed to track customers, manage operations, and scale efficiently. An understanding of tech is required even if not building things in-house.

- Businesses should think of themselves as media companies and look for ways to create shareable visual content on social media to build their audience and attract new customers through user-generated promotion. 

- Price impacts perceived experience - being too cheap or expensive could undermine the value proposition. The goal is finding the right formula, whether that's low prices or high quality at a premium, and sticking to it.

- Celebrating wins from campaigns and innovating based on learnings is important for long term success, rather than endless new campaigns without reflection.

 

- The passage discusses the importance of not immediately rushing into the next campaign after completing one. It is crucial to first complete the final phase of analyzing and learning from the previous campaign. 

- This analysis phase involves hunting down stories from the campaign, collecting numbers and data, interrogating the findings, and learning insights. It is about celebrating successes and sharing learnings with those involved. 

- Capturing these stories, numbers, and insights is important so they can be used powerfully in future campaigns for innovation and improvement. Simply starting the next campaign without this reflection risks repeating mistakes.

- Data and results from campaigns provide valuable insights into what is and isn't working. Measuring aspects like cost per lead, conversions, response rates to different ads/materials allows learning the "truth in the results". 

- After campaigns, it is important to debrief by pulling together those involved to discuss lessons learned while experiences are still fresh. This continuous improvement process of reflection and learning is what allows campaigns and the business to grow faster over time.

 

- The world is facing convergent disruption due to advances in digital technology and demographic shifts from retiring baby boomers. 

- Technologies like AI, automation, and digital tools are making it possible to perform tasks remotely from anywhere in the world at lower costs. This threatens some traditional jobs and business models.

- Demographics are shifting as the large baby boomer generation retires and lives longer. This will strain government resources and transition wealth.

- This disruption is creating a wave that will divide people into "somewheres" who only work locally versus "anywheres" who work digitally from anywhere. 

- To succeed, businesses must adapt an "anywhere" mindset and use technology to scale operations and work in new digital and global ways. Ongoing innovation, campaigns, partnerships and dynamic work are needed to surf the disruption wave instead of being swept away by it. Early adaption is crucial to take advantage of the opportunities from convergent disruption.

 

- Treat this time as a critical moment to stay ahead of changing trends. Maintain a sense of urgency and continually improve. 

- Businesses and teams will emerge playing one of three "games" - struggle, lifestyle, or high performance. Choose which game aligns best with your goals.

- Struggling teams resist change and are stuck in the past. Lifestyle teams prioritize balance and small, flexible operations. High performance teams pursue ambitious goals through long hours and growth.

- Building a campaign-driven enterprise requires assembling a core team with experts in key roles like sales, operations, finance, and a leader as the public face. 

- Start recruiting your team from day one, even if just asking friends for part-time help. Trying to do everything alone will not work in the long run. Having a specialized team allows you to leverage each person's strengths and stay focused on your biggest priorities.

- Determine which type of "game" - struggle, lifestyle, or performance - fits your goals and personality. Then apply campaign-driven enterprise principles to build the optimal team to support that vision in a sustainable way. Continual improvement is also important to stay ahead of changes.

 

Having a high-performance team from the beginning is crucial for any new project or business. While many think they can grow the business first and then hire a team, that approach will lead to exhaustion and falling behind competitors who had a team in place from the start. The clock keeps ticking regardless. Even larger businesses need to recruit top talent first in order to enable future growth. Neglecting to build the right team early on means lost opportunities and wasted time that can't be gotten back.

 

- In their first few years, most founders spend all their time doing sales rather than building a great product or effective marketing campaigns. This spreads them too thin and they become ineffective. 

- Hiring a dedicated salesperson is essential, even if initially on a commission-only basis. A good salesperson can generate more revenue from leads than their cost. 

- Marketing efforts like landing pages and videos won't bear fruit without salespeople to follow up on leads. Appointing someone accountable for sales and marketing is important.

- Key roles for a campaign-driven enterprise include a head of sales, head of operations, and head of finance. 

- The head of sales oversees sales tools and processes. The head of operations focuses on customer satisfaction and net promoter scores. The head of finance secures funding and manages finances and reporting. 

- These specialized roles allow the founder to focus on bigger picture strategies while delegating important day-to-day functions that are needed to grow the business successfully. Hiring for the right roles at the right time is important for scaling up from the initial founder-led phase.

 

The passage summarizes key responsibilities and tasks for the finance person on a campaign-driven enterprise team. It focuses on tended payment terms with added service.

Specifically, it mentions the finance person should focus on fast reporting to provide the team important financial insights, negotiating better supplier terms like extending payment deadlines from 14 to 30 days, actively following up on collections to ensure cash is coming in, and making sure the business is positioned to access additional financing or investment as needed to scale up operations. 

The goal is for the finance person to help optimize the company's cash flow and financial stability through tasks like these, so the overall business and campaigns can continue to grow and perform at a high level. Extending payment terms with suppliers and improving collections are highlighted as specific ways the finance person can help "unlock" more cash for the business on an ongoing basis.

 Here is a summary of the provided text:

The passage encourages shifting one's view of entrepreneurship away from solely creating new things for people to buy, and instead focusing on creating new things for people to get involved in and contribute to. It talks about using your skills and business to positively impact the world through campaigns for change on important issues like clean water, the environment, poverty, and education. The author hopes readers will be inspired to use their talents for good causes that make a difference, such as bundling charitable donations or services with business activities. The overall message is to make the most of one's limited time on earth and leave a legacy through meaningful work that creates value for others.
