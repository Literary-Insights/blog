 Here is a summary of the key points about self and consciousness discussed in the book:

- Neuroscience studies how the brain gives rise to consciousness and self. It explores phenomena like perception, attention, memory, dreaming, meditation, and near-death experiences. 

- Meditation practices from Buddhism aim to cultivate mindfulness, concentration, and insight into the nature of experience. They reveal aspects of consciousness like bare awareness and illusion of self.

- Philosophy analyzes core concepts like awareness, perception, subjectivity, personal identity, free will, and the relationship between mind and body. It draws on both Western and Eastern traditions.

- The book integrates findings and perspectives from neuroscience, meditation, and philosophy to develop a comprehensive picture of consciousness, the sense of self, and their relation to the physical world. 

- Key topics discussed include the illusion of the observing self, nature of perception, pure awareness in meditation, dreamless sleep, possible changes in consciousness with death, and whether the self is ultimately unreal or exists in some diminished sense.

- The aim is to develop mutual understanding between science and contemplative traditions while avoiding uncritical acceptance of claims from either side.

 

- The author first met Francisco Varela while still a teenager and later studied and collaborated with him at the Ecole Polytechnique in Paris in the late 1980s. 

- As part of his unconventional upbringing, the author was introduced to yoga and meditation practices as a child and continues to practice today. 

- The book Waking, Dreaming, Being is the culmination of the author's lifelong concern with ideas related to the self and consciousness, informed both by research and his own experiences with meditation.

- At an MIT conference, the author gave a speech honoring Francisco Varela's work combining phenomenology and neuroscience (neurophenomenology). 

- During a discussion on mental imagery, the Dalai Lama surprisingly conjectured that even the subtlest states of consciousness may require some physical basis, contrary to traditional Buddhist views. 

- This led the author to think about debates he had with Varela on whether consciousness is wholly dependent on or can transcend the brain. He later was able to directly ask the Dalai Lama about this question.

 

- The Dalai Lama notes that Tibetan Buddhists conceive of pure awareness/consciousness as something that lacks embodiment or physical basis. However, he has come to think that even subtle states of consciousness like the "clear light" state at death must have some kind of physical/bodily base. 

- He acknowledges the scientific view that the brain is the basis for mental events, and notes that without the brain, ordinary mind can't function. So subtle states of consciousness likely also require some subtle physical base. But he admits he doesn't know for certain.

- Engaging Buddhism and Western science on this issue is challenging given their cultural/philosophical differences. Both traditions also challenge each other in important ways. 

- An open, rigorous and mutually respectful dialogue is needed to make progress on understanding consciousness and its relationship to the physical brain/body. Both sides need to seriously consider the other's knowledge and perspectives.

- The question of whether consciousness transcends or is wholly dependent on the physical remains open. The approach is to sustain open inquiry and suspension of premature conclusions on this profound question.

 

The book introduces the central idea that the self is a process, not a static thing or entity. It is enacted through the process of awareness, and can change depending on how we are aware. 

Different states of consciousness, like waking, falling asleep, dreaming, mediate different experiences of self. During waking, we enact a bodily self geared to the environment. During dreaming, we identify as the dream ego experiencing the dream world. Lucid dreaming allows awareness of dreaming while still experiencing the dream self. 

Some meditation practices allow witnessing awareness during waking, where we can observe different contents of mind without identifying as any of them. Some traditions claim this is possible even during deep sleep.

The book will explore consciousness and self-experience through the lenses of cognitive science and Indian philosophy. It distinguishes three aspects - awareness, contents of awareness, and identification of some contents as "I" or self. Understanding these three things can help explain how we enact different selves. 

The book weaves together neuroscience and Indian ideas to map different states of consciousness, and how self is experienced and changes within them. This includes wakefulness, sleep, dreaming, lucid dreaming, meditation and the dying process.

 

- The ancient Indian texts called the Upanishads contain the earliest maps of consciousness, delineating four states - waking, dreaming, deep sleep, and a state of pure awareness. 

- The author uses this fourfold structure to explore consciousness and the sense of self across different states. 

- In Indian philosophy, consciousness is defined as that which is luminous (has the power to reveal) and knowing (can apprehend what appears). In different states, consciousness reveals and apprehends either the outer world or inner mental images.

- Meditation trains both focused attention and open awareness. Individuals who can flexibly shift between these modes of awareness may offer new insights about consciousness. 

- Subsequent chapters examine attention and perception in waking state, views on whether consciousness depends on or transcends the brain, falling asleep, dreaming, lucid dreaming, out-of-body experiences, and how different states are associated with distinct brain activity patterns.

- The author aims to integrate ancient yoga practices, modern neuroscience methods, and findings on dreaming, lucid dreaming and altered states of consciousness.

 Here is a summary of the key points about consciousness from the passage:

- The oldest surviving account of the nature of consciousness comes from ancient India, in a dialogue between the sage Yajnavalkya and King Janaka around the 7th century BCE. 

- In response to questions from the king about what light/source of awareness a person has when external sources like the sun, moon, fire, and speech are unavailable, Yajnavalkya concludes it is the self (atman).

- This establishes the self or atman as the innermost source of consciousness and awareness for a person. It implies consciousness is not dependent on external conditions or the senses, but has an internal basis in the self.

- This dialogue is considered one of the earliest philosophical discussions about the nature of consciousness. It points to an internal, self-sufficient source of awareness even in the absence of sensory inputs - a view consistent with later Indian philosophical schools like Yoga and Vedanta.

So in summary, the passage outlines the ancient Indian concept of the self (atman) as the inner source of consciousness and light/awareness for a person, independent of external conditions. It presents one of the earliest recorded philosophical perspectives on consciousness.

 

- The passage contrasts things that are distant/outer/visible vs close/inner/invisible. It discusses the sun, moon, fire, and speech as outer visible phenomena, while arguing the self resides closest as an inner invisible phenomenon. 

- It poses the question of how we can know or understand the self, given that it cannot be directly perceived through outer senses since it is the source of perception itself. 

- It then summarizes Yajnavalkya's answer to the king, which maps out consciousness in three states - waking, dreaming, and deep sleep. Consciousness illuminates the outer world in waking and inner dream world in dreaming. 

- In deep sleep, there are no desires or dreams, and one rests in a peaceful, blissful state absorbed in the universal self. Later traditions argue this implies a subtle form of conscious awareness even in deep sleep.

- The progression traces how things visible in waking and dreaming ultimately derive their visibility from the basic luminosity of consciousness as the inner self. It moves from outer to inner and gross to subtle aspects of awareness.

 

- In Indian philosophy, there are four states or aspects of consciousness: waking, dreaming, deep sleep, and a "fourth" state called turiya. 

- Waking involves outwardly turned consciousness experiencing the world through the senses. Dreaming involves inwardly turned consciousness fabricating mental images. Deep sleep involves a quiescent state with no desires or mental activity. 

- Turiya refers to pure, nondual awareness that underlies the other three states. It is the constant witnessing awareness, not conditioned by changing states. Through meditation, one can realize turiya and see through the identification with transitory mental states.

- The states are not fully discrete but interpenetrating. One can experience aspects of other states within a state, like lucid dreaming. Waking contains memories of dreams and the self-absorption of deep sleep. 

- The Mandukya Upanishad symbolically links the four states to the sacred syllable OM, with each phoneme representing a different level of consciousness from gross to subtle. This underscores the unity of consciousness in its various aspects.

 

- The passage discusses different states of consciousness - waking, dreaming, deep sleep - using a framework from ancient Indian philosophy.

- In waking, consciousness apprehends the outer world through sense perception and conceptualization. The waking state involves perceiving the physical world and understanding it conceptually. 

- In dreaming, consciousness apprehends the inner world of mental images. Dreams involve perceiving images and scenes in the mind, which may or may not be recognized as dream-created.

- In deep sleep, there is an "unknowing but blissful state" due to the absence of images, desires, activities, and the usual "whirling" of the mind. Consciousness enters a state of non-activity and non-experience, offering a foretaste of pure awareness. 

- Across these states, consciousness reveals or manifests phenomena and apprehends them in some way appropriate to the state. It distinguishes awareness itself from its contents and the sense of self or identity.

- Consciousness is defined as that which is luminous and has the capacity for knowing - it reveals phenomena and apprehends or understands them in some manner.

 

- Western and Indian philosophy both debate whether conscious experiences are revealed through "self-illumination" or require some "other illumination". 

- Self-illumination theories propose that conscious experiences directly reveal themselves, without needing any higher-level cognition. Other-illumination theories say conscious experiences need to be cognized by some higher-level awareness in order to be revealed.

- The problem with other-illumination views is that they lead to an infinite regress, as each higher-level cognition would need its own illumination. They also cannot satisfactorily explain how an unconscious higher-level cognition could make a lower-level experience conscious. 

- The self-illumination view, which sees consciousness as intrinsically luminous and self-revealing, avoids these problems. When we are conscious of objects, we are also prereflectively conscious of ourselves. Our awareness witnesses both outer objects and itself.

- The ancient Upanishads of India developed one of humanity's earliest and most sophisticated maps of consciousness through meditative exploration. Their view of consciousness as the fundamental witness or awareness had a profound influence on later Hindu and Buddhist philosophy and psychology.

So in summary, most philosophers accept that conscious experiences directly reveal themselves without requiring any external illumination, based on both philosophical arguments and insights from meditative traditions. Consciousness is seen as intrinsically luminous and self-aware.

 

- The passage describes a phenomenon called "binocular rivalry" where two different images are presented, one to each eye, and the perception alternates unpredictably between the two images rather than fusing into one stable image. 

- This occurs even though the external stimuli do not change. It demonstrates that changes in conscious perception can occur independently of changes in the stimuli.

- Scientists have used binocular rivalry to study the brain activity specifically associated with conscious perception. By comparing brain activity when a person reports perceiving one image versus the other, they aim to identify the "neural correlates of consciousness."

- The early Buddhist view rejected the Upanishadic idea of a single, eternal consciousness. The Buddha taught that consciousness arises dependent on conditions and is contingency on name-and-form (mental and physical components that comprise experience).

- Name-and-form and consciousness mutually condition each other like two bundles of reeds propping each other up. Investigating phenomena like binocular rivalry helps explore how moments of consciousness depend on the physical and psychological makeup of the perceiver.

 

- Binocular rivalry is a phenomenon where different images presented to each eye lead to alternations in conscious visual perception, such as seeing one image then the other. 

- Neuroscientists have used binocular rivalry experiments to study the neural correlates of consciousness - the brain activity directly linked to specific conscious visual experiences.

- Early experiments in monkeys found that neuronal activity in early visual areas correlated more with the stimulus, while activity in later, higher-level visual areas correlated more with the animal's reported perception. 

- Studies in humans also found correlations between perception and early visual areas like V1 in addition to higher areas. 

- This suggests there is no single locus in the brain for conscious perception, but rather distributed and coordinated activity across multiple areas.

- The researcher Diego Cosmelli conducted experiments using neurophenomenology to better capture how binocular rivalry experience changes over time, like waves. 

- He used novel analysis methods to track recurrent but variable neural patterns linked to conscious perception as it unfolded over time. 

- The findings helped reveal how coordinated oscillations in activity across different brain regions corresponded to moments of conscious visual perception during binocular rivalry.

 

- The study by Cosmelli et al. looked at neural activity during binocular rivalry, where the brain alternates between perceiving one of two competing images. 

- They found that periods of conscious perception correlated with large-scale synchronized neural oscillations across different brain regions. The phase of neural responses was synchronized.

- Previous studies by Varela, Rodriguez, and others also linked moments of conscious perception to widespread patterns of synchronized gamma oscillations in the brain. 

- Cosmelli's study showed these synchronized oscillations form a network that builds up as one image is perceived, then dissolves as perception switches to the other image. The alternation in perception corresponds to alternating waves of synchronized neural activity.

- A follow up study by Doesburg and Ward found these synchronized gamma oscillations were nested within slower theta oscillations. They propose the fast gamma synchrony integrates neural features into coherent perceptions, while the slow theta rhythms define discrete moments or "frames" of perception.

- This raises questions about whether perception is truly discrete or continuous. Early Buddhist philosophy and William James both used the metaphor of a "stream" of consciousness, but differed on whether it was continuous or composed of discrete moments.

 

- Abhidharma philosophers believed that consciousness appears continuous but is actually made up of discrete moments of awareness. 

- Each moment of awareness consists of a primary awareness along with various mental factors that qualify the awareness. The mental factors determine how the object is experienced and characterized. 

- There are always at least five ethically neutral mental factors present - contact, feeling, perception, intention, and attention. These perform basic cognitive functions like touching the object, feeling it, discerning it, directing awareness, and orienting to the object.

- Contact establishes the relationship between sensory faculty, object, and awareness. Feeling gives the affective tone of pleasant, unpleasant, neutral. Perception identifies and distinguishes the object. Intention determines the ethical quality. Attention orients awareness and binds the other factors to the object.

- Abhidharma mapped out over 50 mental factors and categorized them based on their ethical impact on awareness and experience. This analysis aimed to understand how awareness conditions experience and suffering.

 

- According to the Abhidharma Buddhist philosophy, cognition unfolds in rapid, discrete moments called "citta" or "mind moments". These moments arise and pass away rapidly in succession, rather than as a continuous stream. 

- Contemporary research in visual perception finds that our eyes rapidly sample scenes in quick succession rather than taking everything in at once, giving the illusion of continuity. The Abhidharma view is analogous, with discrete cognitive moments arising sequentially too fast to perceive discreteness.

- The Abhidharma texts debated how long a mind moment lasts, with estimates ranging from milliseconds to nanoseconds. Later theories argued they must be instantaneous to accord with Buddhist impermanence doctrine.

- An experiment Francisco Varela conducted in 1979 explored whether perception is continuous or discrete by measuring the influence of brain alpha rhythms on the perception of flashing lights. The results supported the idea that perception falls into discrete perceptual frames linked to brain rhythms.

- This offered preliminary evidence that the discrete nature of perception could potentially be measured, as proposed by the Abhidharma notion of discrete mind moments. However, follow up studies struggled to consistently replicate the original findings.

 

- Ongoing alpha (8-12 Hz) and theta (5-7 Hz) brainwaves have been linked to perception. You are more likely to miss a stimulus when it occurs during the trough of an alpha wave, and more likely to detect it when it occurs during the alpha wave crest. 

- This suggests perception happens through successive periodic cycles rather than continuously, similar to the wake-sleep cycle. Moments of perception correspond to excitatory "up" phases, while moments of non-perception correspond to inhibitory "down" phases. 

- Even with sustained attention, perception appears to be discrete and periodic, fluctuating with the phase of ongoing theta oscillations. The "spotlight" of attention may blink on and off every 100-150 milliseconds like a strobe light.

- Studies suggest attention samples information periodically, and meditation may increase this sampling rate by tuning brain rhythms like theta oscillations involved in attention. 

- Measuring moments of awareness is difficult, as there are subjective and objective criteria. Some research has found awarenessof stimuli presented as briefly as 17 milliseconds, and meditation can improve this. The Buddhist estimate of 15 milliseconds for observable mind moments does not seem unreasonable.

 

- A study investigated participants' ability to reliably detect visual targets presented for very short durations (17-41 milliseconds). It found that while nearly all participants could reliably detect the 17ms targets, only a few "high achievers" could reliably determine when their responses to those targets were correct. 

- This suggests most participants had objective awareness of the targets but no subjective/"access" awareness of their own sensitivity. Their awareness and ability to report on it were "dissociated".

- From an Abhidharma perspective, all participants would have a basic level of phenomenal awareness of the 17ms targets, but only the high achievers had cognitive access to this awareness to inform their thinking and reports. 

- Meditation may increase both objective and subjective measures of awareness by refining attention. Studies found meditation practitioners showed reduced "attentional blink" effects and improved detection of second visual targets, suggesting meditation strengthened attention and awareness.

 

- Open awareness meditation involves relaxing the focus on an explicit object and instead maintaining attentive awareness of whatever thoughts, feelings, sensations arise moment to moment without judgment or reaction. 

- This trains meta-awareness or awareness of awareness. One observes the characteristics and fluctuations of awareness itself from moment to moment.

- Theravada Vipassana meditation begins with focused attention on the breath and then shifts to open awareness once attentional stability is developed. 

- Studies find Vipassana makes the mind less "clingy" to objects, allowing attention to quickly perceive one object and let it go to be ready for the next. 

- Brain waves linked to perception (theta rhythms) become more precisely synchronized to perceptual targets after Vipassana practice, reflecting improved ability to sustain attention.

- Performing attention tasks as meditation further strengthens moment-to-moment attentional stability and consistency of brain responses. 

- Meditation in experienced practitioners can even alter basic visual processes like binocular rivalry rates, showing strong influence of voluntary attention on perception.

 Here is a summary of key points about ural rhythms:

- Ural rhythms refer to neural oscillations in the theta frequency band (4-8 Hz) that are thought to shape the stream of sensory events into discrete moments of conscious perception. 

- Studies on Vipassana meditation suggest it may increase the "sampling rate" of attention by fine-tuning theta oscillations. This could increase the brain's ability to perceive discrete moments in perception and attention rather than getting stuck on one moment.

- Neuroscience findings support the Abhidharma Buddhist philosophical view that conscious awareness occurs in discrete moments rather than as a uniform stream. Meditation may sensitize one to the discrete, gappy nature of awareness that is ordinarily overlooked. 

- Intensive Vipassana meditation seems to refine how the brain rhythmically organizes sensory flow into discrete perceptual moments through influencing theta oscillations in ongoing brain activity related to conscious perception.

- In summary, research indicates ural rhythms play a key role in shaping conscious experience into discrete moments, and meditation may influence these rhythms to alter how discrete moments are perceived.

 Here is a summary of the key points about perceptions in the Buddhist view according to the presented text:

- The Yogācāra philosophers distinguished different types of mental consciousness, including a preattentive "ego consciousness" or "afflicted mind consciousness". This provides a sense of "I" or "Me" and projects this feeling onto experiences, mistakenly taking them to belong to a separate self. 

- In reality, the "store consciousness" that holds our experiences is constantly changing from moment to moment, like a flowing river. Nothing in it is wholly present or could function as the owner of experiences. The feeling that consciousness has an "I" at its core is based on an illusion.

- This ego consciousness distorts experiences by reifying the interdependent aspects (inner experience and outer object) into a separate subject and object. But truly there is just a single, non-dual event or "manifestation". 

- The sense of a single, continuous "I" owning all experiences is false, as the store consciousness and sense of self undergo many changes between experiences like perception and a later memory.

- Differentiating these philosophical perspectives on consciousness helps distinguish transient perceptual experiences from more enduring background states like waking, dreaming, sleeping, and the sense of self that conditions experience.

 

- The Dalai Lama has had a longstanding interest in science and dialogue between Buddhism and science. He first met Francisco Varela at a conference in 1983 which sparked their collaboration. 

- Through Varela and others, the Mind and Life Institute was founded to facilitate structured dialogues between the Dalai Lama and scientists. This led to contemplative neuroscience research investigating how meditation affects the brain.

- At an MIT conference in 2003 called "Investigating the Mind", the Dalai Lama discussed pure awareness with neuroscientists and Buddhist scholars in front of over 1,000 people. This conference marked a turning point in establishing contemplative neuroscience as a new field of research.

- The dialogues and research program stimulated by the Dalai Lama and Varela has explored topics like attention, emotion, and mental imagery from both scientific and Buddhist perspectives. It aimed to investigate the effects of contemplative practices scientifically and find ways to apply beneficial insights more widely.

So in summary, the Dalai Lama played a key role in catalyzing the new field of contemplative neuroscience through his ongoing dialogues with scientists on how Buddhism and science understand the mind.

 

- The study looked at long-term Tibetan Buddhist meditators practicing "pure compassion meditation" compared to novice meditators. 

- During meditation, the experienced meditators generated very strong synchronized brain waves (gamma oscillations) across the brain, more so than any healthy individuals previously reported. This pattern correlated with alert, clear conscious awareness. 

- Even in the resting state before meditation, experienced meditators showed different brain wave patterns (higher fast wave/slow wave ratio) than novices. 

- During meditation, the experienced meditators' brain wave ratios increased and remained elevated after, indicating a new resting state, while novices did not change. 

- More experienced meditators showed higher pre-meditation fast wave activity, linking long-term practice to brain changes. 

- The findings suggest meditation is a mental skill and long-term practice brings lasting brain changes, though individual differences prior to meditation cannot be ruled out. Other studies more directly link meditation to brain/attention changes.

 

- Researchers studied expert Tibetan Buddhist meditators to correlate changes in subjective experience (reported clarity/vividness of awareness) with objective neural measures (gamma EEG activity). 

- When the meditators reported increased clarity or vividness of awareness, there were corresponding increases in gamma band power, suggesting gamma synchrony may correlate with conscious experience moment-to-moment. 

- Only highly trained meditators could observe and report on subtle changes in awareness qualities from one second to the next, allowing correlation with rapid neural changes recorded by EEG.

- This work provides initial evidence that neural correlates of consciousness may fluctuate along with reported changes in conscious experience qualities in expert meditators. It helped relate dynamic changes in phenomenology to neurophysiology.

- Remaining key differences exist between Buddhist and Western scientific views of consciousness - Western views see it as wholly brain-dependent while Buddhism sees it as having an existence independent of the brain. This dialogue on the nature of consciousness aims to confront these differences.

 

- Nalanda University was an ancient center of Buddhist learning in India that was at its peak between the 7th-11th centuries AD. It had over 1000 residents and attracted scholars from as far as China. Its library contained hundreds of thousands of volumes. 

- Nalanda's curriculum focused on the systematic study of logic, epistemology, and metaphysics. These teachings form the basis of Tibetan Buddhism, especially the Gelug school associated with the Dalai Lama.

- Tibetan Buddhism sees itself as the inheritor of the "Nalanda tradition." The Dalai Lama often refers to Tibetan Buddhists as the holders of this tradition. 

- The presentation focused on reconciling Buddhist and Western philosophical views of consciousness/mind and its relationship to the physical body/brain. 

- Key differences are that Buddhism sees pure awareness/consciousness as non-physical, whereas neuroscience sees all mental states as physical brain states. There is also an "explanatory gap" between consciousness and the physical in Western philosophy.

- The Buddhist view is based on ancient Indian philosophers like Dharmakirti who reasoned that consciousness and matter have different natures, so one cannot arise from the other, though they can condition each other. 

- The Dalai Lama acknowledges both the Buddhist view of non-physical consciousness, but also says subtle consciousness must have some subtle physical base, according to tantric Buddhist teachings. 

- The dialogue aimed to clarify the relationship between these Buddhist perspectives and reconciling them with scientific views of mind-body relationships.

 

- The Dalai Lama is addressing Tibetan Buddhist scholars and monks in the room. He notes that in Tibetan Buddhism, there are different levels of consciousness - gross, subtle, very subtle. 

- Up until the point when the "eighty conceptions indicative of mental processes" fully dissolve at death, mental processes are contingent on and require the brain. 

- After they dissolve, the "appearance" phase begins, which transcends the brain according to Tibetan Buddhist philosophy. This phase involves a very deep and subtle level of awareness.

- The Dalai Lama wonders if this very subtle level of consciousness, conceptualized in Tibetan Buddhism as the "clear light state", could be scientifically investigated by experimenting on advanced meditators who are able to recognize and rest in this state. 

- He recalls a past attempt to do this using monitoring equipment on meditators as they died, but it did not yield results. 

- Arthur Zajonc asks if the clear light state only emerges at death, or also in deep meditation. The Dalai Lama confirms it can occur in meditation for advanced practitioners through certain techniques.

- He encourages using highly trained meditators as "laboratories" where scientists can investigate extraordinary meditation-induced experiences firsthand.

 

- The Dalai Lama previously suggested investigating the clear light state by monitoring great meditation practitioners as they die, using cameras. This could help examine the phenomenon scientifically. 

- The best candidate would be someone able to achieve the clear light state through meditation while alive, rather than waiting until death. They should show physical signs like cessation of respiration and brain activity similar to dying. 

- The meditative state may be like hibernation, with dramatic slowing of metabolic activity through deep meditation rather than death. There was no time to raise this question further.

- The Dalai Lama believes some past practitioners reporting these experiences were not all liars. As a young man he was keen to practice these techniques but now prefers an ordinary death. 

- Direct experience alone cannot show whether pure awareness depends on the brain. We need neuroscience to discover this. The Dalai Lama is open to the possibility pure awareness has neural correlates despite some statements to the contrary. 

- From a neuroscience perspective, if highly realized meditators experience pure awareness with functioning brains, it implies dependence on the brain until proven otherwise. The neuronal basis is currently unknown.

 Here is a summary of the key points from the first pages of The Universe in a Single Atom:

- The Dalai Lama believes that if scientific analysis were to conclusively demonstrate certain Buddhist claims as false, then those claims must be abandoned. However, he cautions that "absence of evidence is not evidence of absence." Just because science has not found evidence for something does not mean it has disproven its existence. 

- First-person reports of experiences like pure awareness cannot prove those experiences are not contingent on the brain. They only describe the subjective qualities, not the physical nature. And they are retroactive interpretations, not observations of the experience itself.

- Third-party observations also need modern measurements to determine precise physiological correlates of altered states. 

- Science has not proven the nonexistence of consciousness independent of the brain, but there is also no compelling empirical evidence for it. 

- The deeper point is that consciousness itself cannot be directly or independently observed through the scientific method. Science has no way to detect or measure consciousness itself. So science cannot have the final say on matters concerning consciousness. The author argues primacy must be given to direct experiences of consciousness.

In summary, the passages discuss the limits of science in making definitive claims about Buddhist concepts like pure awareness, while also acknowledging the lack of strong evidence currently supporting those concepts. The Dalai Lama's caveat and the primacy of experience are key ideas.

 

- Philosopher David Chalmers remarks that we have no "consciousness meter" to directly measure consciousness. Consciousness is a subjective, qualitative experience that cannot be directly observed or quantified in the way that physical properties like temperature can be measured. 

- When scientists talk about developing a consciousness meter, what they really mean is finding observable neural correlates of consciousness, like patterns of brain activity, that correlate with states deemed consciously based on verbal reports or behaviors. But these are still not direct measures of consciousness itself.

- Any neural criteria for consciousness depends on verbal reports or behaviors as the primary indicators of conscious experience. But this raises problems, as we can't be sure someone lacking reports or behaviors may still be consciously experiencing something. 

- Science gives no access to consciousness that is independent of consciousness. All scientific investigation relies on consciousness through observation, hypothesis formation, communication of results, etc. Science operates within the horizons set by consciousness. 

- Direct experience has primacy over scientific approaches. We cannot stand outside of consciousness to objectively study it, as consciousness is our way of being and the basis for any objective knowledge. Neuroscience cannot reduce or fully explain consciousness without remainder.

 

- Neuroscience provides evidence that consciousness is correlated with brain activity, but does not demonstrate an identity between the two. The identity claim is a metaphysical interpretation, not proven by the evidence itself. 

- The relationship between mental and neuronal events goes both ways - mental states can affect brain states and vice versa. Consciousness also depends on the embodied, embedded nature of the brain within the body and environment.

- We cannot infer that consciousness has ontological primacy (is the fundamental nature of reality) just because it has epistemological or existential primacy (we experience reality through consciousness). 

- The view presented is a form of emergentism, but differs from standard emergentism which sees physical nature as fundamentally non-mental. A new view of what 'physical' means is needed to account for consciousness naturally. 

- Dharmakirti's argument against reducing consciousness to matter is still valid, as standard emergentism is unintelligible given a non-mental conception of the physical. Panpsychism and dualism proposed in response also have issues. 

- We need a non-dualistic framework where physical and experiential are not mutually exclusive but imply each other, derived from something neutral between them. This involves revising our understanding of physical nature.

- To relate consciousness and brain properly, equal attention must be given to first-person experience through contemplative practices, not just third-person behavioral/physiological data.

 

- Neurophenomenology provides a framework that brings together contemplative practices and scientific study of the mind and life. It aims to see both as grounded in direct experience. 

- Francisco Varela introduced neurophenomenology as a research program to study phenomena like lucid dreaming in a balanced way integrating first-person experience and third-person scientific observation.

- The rest of the book will use this framework to examine different modes of consciousness and senses of self, starting with dreaming. 

- Lucid dreaming is discussed as an experience that raises questions about the relationship between the dreaming self, brain, body, and sense of agency during dreams. It offers a model for how the mind can influence the brain and body.

- The chapter will propose distinguishing between the dreaming self and dream ego, and discuss how nonlucid and lucid dreams differentially frame experience. It will also examine different types of dream experiences and states of consciousness on the boundary between waking and dreaming.

 

- Hypnagogic imagery refers to the images, thoughts, and sensations that occur as a person is falling asleep. They arise from memories and experiences from that day or even earlier memories. 

- Poets like Robert Frost and Andrew Marvell have described experiencing hypnagogic imagery, such as reliving activities from the day or seeing colored thoughts. 

- Scientific studies of hypnagogic imagery began in the 19th century with researchers like Maury and Müller observing their own experiences. Later studies involved waking subjects during sleep onset to report what they were experiencing.

- Studies have found hypnagogic imagery can arise from both recent and older memories, and even from memories not consciously accessible through declarative memory. Playing Tetris led to Tetris-like imagery, including in amnesic patients.

- Modern research combines first-person self-observation methods with third-person brain scans to better understand the neurophysiology underlying hypnagogic experiences. Researchers like Nielsen have developed systematic self-observation techniques. 

- Hypnagogic imagery appears to arise as the brain transitions from wakefulness to sleep, involving both recent and implicit memories as well as changes in brain activity and ego boundaries. Balancing attention and awareness is important for observing the experiences.

 

The passage describes various methods for observing hypnagogic (half-asleep) states, including observing mental activity as you drift off to sleep and purposely slowing the transition to try to remember more details. It discusses the types of phenomena commonly experienced in hypnagogia, such as lights/colors, drifting scenes/faces, thought-image combinations, and mini-dream episodes. 

Neuroscientifically, it outlines the stages of sleep based on EEG brain wave patterns, from wakefulness through stages 1-4 of non-REM sleep. The hypnagogic state occurs in the transition from wakefulness to stage 1 sleep. More recent research is moving away from rigid staging models towards dynamic monitoring of subtler brain activity changes. 

One study identified nine distinct EEG stages within the hypnagogic period and found experiential reports correspond to these changes. Kinesthetic images peak early while visual images increase later. Dreamlike experiences occur when alpha waves subside and theta waves increase. In general, hypnagogic experience reflects the shifting dynamics of brain wave patterns during the waking-sleep transition.

 Here is a summary of the key points about shifting patterns of brain activity as we fall asleep from the passage:

- As we fall asleep, we begin to experience hypnagogic phenomena like images, thoughts, and sensations as our level of arousal changes. 

- Neuroscientists have studied brain wave patterns associated with different types of hypnagogic experiences like visual versus kinesthetic imagery using EEG recordings combined with first-person reports.

- Meditators experience hypnagogic phenomena like images and thoughts as they slip in and out of a drowsy state during long periods of meditation. Studying meditators could help neuroscience better correlate brain states with conscious experiences in the hypnagogic state. 

- As we begin to fall asleep, there is a slackening of the sense of self and an absorbed identification with spontaneously arising mental images and thoughts. This shows the sense of self is not fixed and consciousness extends beyond the normal waking ego. 

- The hypnagogic state blurs boundaries between self and other, inside and outside, as consciousness breaks away from the structured ego of normal waking experience.

 

- The person awoke from a dream and spent the rest of the night thinking through the implications of an idea that came to them in the hypnagogic state between waking and sleeping. 

- The hypnagogic state involves relaxation, absorption in thoughts/memories, synesthesia, symbolic thinking. It can tap into creative problem solving by loosening the ego boundaries compared to waking consciousness. 

- Some psychologists view it as a "regression" to childhood modes of thinking due to reduced reality testing and volitional control over thoughts. Memories from early childhood may surface. However, others see it not necessarily as regressive but as a "double consciousness" that could be progressive.

- Meditation can induce this double consciousness of watching the mind while being aware of surroundings. However, meditation traditions generally counsel against getting stuck in dreamlike states and view spontaneously arising images as illusions to be ignored. 

- The hypnagogic state involves both a relaxation of ego boundaries and a spellbound identification of consciousness with thoughts/images. Attention becomes fascinated rather than distracted. Consciousness is "captive to itself" in this state according to Sartre.

 

- Dreams can be experienced from either a first-person or third-person perspective. First-person dreams feel immersive, like you are seeing through your own eyes. Third-person dreams feel more dissociated, like you are watching yourself from the outside. 

- Memories can also be recalled from either a first-person (field memory) or third-person (observer memory) perspective. Field memories involve reliving the experience through your own senses, while observer memories involve watching yourself from an external viewpoint.

- Shifting between these perspectives in dreams and memories involves switching between experiencing the self as the subject of awareness versus the object of awareness. These are also known as the "I" (subject) and "Me" (object) senses of self. 

- Dreams and memories illustrate that we have both an internal sense of self as the experiencer, and an external sense of self as something that can be observed from outside our own experience. These two senses of self, or modalities for experiencing the self, carry over into both dreaming and remembering.

 Here is a summary of the key details:

- The passage describes an experience of lucid dreaming, where the dreamer realizes they are dreaming while still in the dream state. 

- In the dream, the dreamer is walking in a hotel hallway. They suddenly remember they are actually lying in bed sleeping and dreaming. 

- To test if they are truly dreaming, the dreamer looks away from and back to a red exit sign, noticing the letters are now jumbled - confirming they are dreaming. 

- The dreamer then does some intentional dream control acts like leaping to the ceiling and flying down the hall. 

- When passing through a wall, the visual scene turns gray with color flashes. The dreamer cannot stabilize the visual world and starts feeling claustrophobic. 

- The dreamer then experiences a sense of paralysis, not in their dream body but in their real sleeping body. This causes a feeling that they have a double body - one dreaming and one sleeping in bed. 

So in summary, the passage describes the dreamer's experience of realizing they are dreaming, testing that realization, attempting some dream control, but then experiencing instability in the dream state and a sensation of paralysis transferring to their physical body.

 

- The passage discusses the distinction between the "dreaming self" and the "dream ego" in lucid dreams. The dreaming self is the awareness that recognizes that one is dreaming, while the dream ego experiences the dream from within. 

- It provides an example of a lucid dream experienced by writer Dorion Sagan after a talk given by Evan Thompson. In the dream, Sagan realizes he is dreaming when he misses his bus, which allows him to fly and observe vivid visions of the day and night sky simultaneously. 

- Lucid dreams illustrate how perspective shifts when one realizes they are dreaming. Memories from waking life can also become accessible. Factors like melatonin, waking up at 3am, and presleep memory exercises may induce lucid dreams. 

- Sigmund Freud did not properly recognize or analyze lucid dreaming in his seminal book The Interpretation of Dreams, limiting Western understanding of this state until more recent scientific investigation. His theoretical framework did not allow for the possibility of realizing one is dreaming from within the dream state.

 

- Freud's view was that all dreams serve the purpose of fulfilling wishes and prolonging sleep by representing wish fulfillments in a disguised way. Thinking "it's only a dream" helps keep one asleep by denying disturbances.

- Nietzsche anticipated Freud in saying we implicitly know dreams are not real ("semblance"). Sometimes this can be explicit, as in lucid dreams where one knows "it's a dream, I will dream on."

- For Freud, thoughts of dreams being unreal are just another product of dream disguise by the dream work. He acknowledges lucid dreaming but sees it also as wish fulfillment, to observe dreams. 

- The problem is lucid dreams are not disguised - wishes are consciously accessible. Freud's distinction between manifest and latent content doesn't apply. 

- Freud devalues dream experience itself by focusing only on symbolic meaning. This led him to ignore distinctive features of lucid dreaming like clarity, emotions, and explicit dream awareness.

 

- Lucid dreaming refers to being aware that you are dreaming while the dream is occurring. This allows you to think about and direct your attention to the dreamlike quality of your state. 

- Simply dreaming that you are aware you are dreaming is different from actually being consciously aware within the dream. The former lacks the clarity and ability to observe and direct attention that characterizes the latter.

- Techniques like hypnagogic imagery aim to carry waking awareness into the dream state without losing the detached, observing perspective. This allows one to directly experience the dream state rather than just dream of being lucid. 

- Noticing discrepancies between dreams and real life, like unusual objects or events, can trigger lucid dreaming by prompting realization that one is dreaming. This shifts the dream experience by increasing vividness and clarity without reducing cognitive function.

- While lucid dreams may involve some control over dream content, being consciously aware of the dream state is the distinguishing factor, regardless of control capabilities within the dream.

 

- Jorge Luis Borges describes lucid dreaming in his short story "Dreamtigers." He recounts how as a child he would dream of tigers, and later as an adult trying to consciously conjure a tiger in his dreams but being unable to control the exact details. This depicts how in lucid dreams one can be aware they are dreaming but not fully control the dream content. 

- Scientists Keith Hearne and Stephen LaBerge discovered that eye movements in dreams correlate with physical eye movements during REM sleep. They had lucid dreamers use prearranged eye movement signals to indicate when they became lucid, verifying lucid dreaming in the lab.

- Further studies tracked time perception, motor tasks, and brain activity in lucid dreams. Time elapsed similarly to waking, but some motor actions took longer. Brain areas for motor actions were still active during lucid dream enactment of tasks.

- Communication experiments allowed dreamers to respond to cues like tones by signaling hearing them, demonstrating two-way interaction between dreaming and waking states. 

- Brain imaging shows lucid dreaming involves heightened activity in prefrontal and parietal cortices associated with metacognition and self-awareness, distinguishing it from normal dreaming.

 

- Studies have found increased activity in the gamma frequency range (36-45 Hz) in frontal and frontolateral brain regions during lucid dreaming, compared to nonlucid REM sleep. This suggests higher neural synchrony/coordination across brain areas.

- Lucid dreaming also shows increased "EEG coherence" or synchronization of brain waves across different areas, a sign of integrated brain activity seen during waking consciousness. 

- This suggests lucid dreaming adopts a coherent neural pattern characteristic of alert waking, without leaving REM sleep.

- Increased activity is found specifically in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, important for self-awareness and willful control. This supports the hypothesis that activity in this region must increase for lucidity. 

- Another study using fMRI confirmed increased activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and a broader frontoparietal network linked to attention, long-term memory, and sense of self/identity.

- This indicates lucid dreaming reactivates distributed brain networks crucial for attention and human self-awareness, rather than being localized to one brain area. 

- There is debate around whether lucid dreaming represents a dissociative or integrative state. Some key points in the summary argue it is more integrative than dissociative.

 

- Lucid dreaming involves becoming consciously aware that one is dreaming while the dream is still occurring. This allows the dreamer to influence and direct the content of the dream. 

- Dream yoga is a Tibetan Buddhist meditative practice that cultivates lucid dreaming. It aims to view both waking and dream experiences as equally dreamlike and devoid of independent existence.

- Dream yoga trains practitioners to sustain mindfulness and awareness that waking experiences are like a dream. This habit carries over to the dream state to induce lucid dreaming. 

- Western approaches to lucid dreaming like "reality testing" operate on the premise that waking reality is stable and mind-independent, while dreams are unstable. They train dreamers to test if they are awake or dreaming.

- Dream yoga challenges the premise that waking reality is independent of the mind. Its goal is to realize that both waking and dream states are brought forth through imaginative perception, lacking substantiality. This allows dreamers to "wake up" within the dream.

So in summary, dream yoga is a Buddhist meditative practice that uses lucid dreaming as a method to realize the dreamlike nature of both waking and dream experiences.

 

Instead of reality testing to determine if they are dreaming or waking, dream yoga encourages viewing all experiences, whether dreaming or waking, as equally dreamlike. It encourages meditators to see phenomena as mentally constructed and mutable, rather than solid and objective. The goal is to cultivate a lucid and flexible mind that can deliberately transform dream experiences and eventually see through the illusion of separate self and other within both dreaming and waking states. Downward mental causation, where the mind can influence brain activity and bodily processes, provides evidence that the dreaming mind is not merely a reflection of the sleeping brain, but rather both mind and brain mutually influence each other. Experiences like lucid dreaming demonstrate how intentional mental acts can correlate with and potentially cause changes in physiological functioning.

 

- Lucid dreaming represents a normal human ability to be aware during dreaming. However, it is rare if without teaching or training. Similarly, language skills require teaching. 

- Dream yoga, practiced in some Eastern traditions, aims to teach lucid dreaming as well as transform the mind at a deeper level. It targets delusions about what is real in both waking and dreaming states. 

- A neuroscience model by Allan Hobson treats dreams as epiphenomena of REM sleep caused by random brainstem activation. But lucid dreaming shows the mind can influence dreams through attention and intention. 

- Dream yoga cultivates not just lucid dreaming but also "dreams of clarity" arising from meditative insights. This implies the mind can alter how the brain and body sleep through training. While research is needed, dream yoga may produce deeper changes in dreams and consciousness beyond mere lucid dream induction.

In summary, the passage discusses how lucid dreaming abilities normally require teaching, compares this to language learning, outlines Tibetan Buddhist dream yoga practices aimed at transforming consciousness, and critically examines a neuroscientific model of dreaming in light of findings from lucid dreaming research and contemplative traditions.

 

The passage argues that dreaming is a form of imagination, not hallucination. It draws a distinction between hallucination and imagination. Hallucination involves falsely perceiving something that is not there, while imagination involves mentally evoking or simulating something absent. 

When we dream, we are imagining and simulating experiences, not falsely perceiving them. Dream imagery depends directly on attention in the same way sensory imagination does - what we imagine or dream appears to be determined by the focus of our attention. This similarity suggests dreaming resembles imagination more than hallucination.

While neuroscience studies have found increased brain activity in areas associated with perception during dreaming, the data does not definitively show that dreams are hallucinations rather than imaginings. The conception of dreams as hallucinations is a conceptual model used to explain the data, not an objective finding. Phenomenologically, the experience of dreaming seems more like imagination than hallucination.

 

- The passage explores the relationship between dreaming, imagination, and perception. It argues that dreaming is a form of spontaneous mental simulation or imagining oneself in a world. 

- Key features of dreaming include cognitive and sensory imagination. We identify with our dream ego both through imagining our dream body and through cognitive imagination of being that ego. 

- Imagination also plays a role in memory, anticipation, and sense of self in waking life. Dreaming involves losing agency over our imagination. 

- Lucid dreaming involves gaining awareness that we are imagining the dream and ability to guide the dream imagery. This distinguishes it from dreaming we are dreaming.

- Dream yoga aims to enhance imaginative abilities like recognizing, altering, and releasing dream imagery. 

- The idea that wakefulness could also be considered a dreamlike state is discussed, with consciousness seen as generated within the brain rather than from sensory inputs alone. The difference between dreaming and waking lies in how sensory information influences conscious experience.

So in summary, the passage examines the relationship between dreaming, imagination, and perception, arguing that dreaming is a form of spontaneous mental simulation through imagination.

 

- Both ancient Indian views and modern neuroscience conceive of wakefulness and dreaming as two states of consciousness modulated by different factors - senses in wakefulness and memory/emotion in dreaming. 

- They reject the idea that senses produce consciousness. Rather, senses and memories change the expression of consciousness but do not create it. The same underlying consciousness is present in both states.

- However, the author departs from some views that see wakefulness and dreaming as exactly the same kind of experience differing only externally. Dreams and wakefulness differ experientially in attention and volition.

- Perception is not online hallucination constrained by senses, but sensorimotor engagement with the world. Dreaming is not offline hallucination but spontaneous imagination. 

- Reality testing and dream yoga both aim to distinguish states, but dream yoga also sees wakefulness as dreamlike due to its mind-dependence. Mindfulness of this may help lucidity in dreams.

- Both ancient philosophy and modern views grapple with distinguishing states but agree we can reliably know wakefulness through reflection, not dreaming due to lack of reflection.

 

- Sartre argues we can never reflect on or be aware of our own dreaming state while dreaming, as any reflection would require waking up and leaving the dream. 

- However, this gets it backwards - we can be aware of dreaming and have "lucid dreams" where we realize we are dreaming while still dreaming. 

- Further, through "false awakenings" in dreams where we think we have woken up but are still dreaming, we cannot confirm we are awake simply through reflection or thought. 

- Indian philosophy discusses "dreams within dreams" and the idea that we can never be certain if we have truly woken up from any given experience, as we may wake again to find it was also a dream. 

- Śaṅkara argued that waking experience has more "reality" than dreams as it includes recognition of dreams, while dreams do not include recognition of waking. Reality refers to experiences not yet contradicted or canceled by another.

So in summary, through concepts like lucid dreaming and false awakenings, we cannot rely on reflection or thought alone to distinguish dreaming from waking states.

 

According to the criterion presented, waking experience has greater reality than dream experience because it is less subject to cancellation or contradiction. Dream experiences are constantly being revoked by other dreams or by waking life, like the text in a dream shifting between English and Chinese. 

Waking experience has more stability and allows for greater awareness of one's state and cognitive control, like in lucid dreaming. However, lucid dreaming actually reinforces the idea that waking has greater reality, since in a lucid dream one is awake within the dream and thus waking encompasses dreaming. 

The dream state does not include an understanding of waking life the way waking life includes an understanding of dreaming, either through ordinary experiences or through lucid dreams when one remembers waking life while dreaming. So "waking" represents a higher-order concept that subsumes both ordinary waking and lucid dreaming. 

The passage then discusses how the Daoist idea presented in Zhuangzi's Butterfly Dream parable offers a different perspective - that each state, waking and dreaming, should be fully accepted rather than one being seen as more "real." There is radical acceptance of all experiences rather than a hierarchical ranking of them.

 

- The passage discusses out-of-body experiences (OBEs) and the concept of astral projection from a yogic/theosophical perspective. 

- As a child, the author had an OBE where they floated above their physical body and saw themselves from above. This was explained to them as an astral projection experience.

- Yoga and Theosophy describe different "bodies" or sheaths that make up one's being - the physical, astral, causal, etc. The astral body is said to travel during dreams and OBEs.

- As an adult studying neuroscience and philosophy of mind, the author now sees OBEs as altered states of consciousness dependent on the brain. They do not demonstrate separability of consciousness from the body. 

- OBEs alter one's normal sense of bodily self-awareness (ownership, agency, location) but do not show disembodiment. They are mental simulations that nonetheless feel real due to voluntary control.

So in summary, the passage traces the author's perspectives on OBEs from a childhood yogic view to a more materialist neuroscientific view as an adult. It presents OBEs as altered states rather than evidence of a non-physical soul or disembodied consciousness.

 

- In an out-of-body experience (OBE), a person sees their physical body from a vantage point outside and above it. They experience being located at this external viewpoint. 

- OBEs involve both visual and vestibular perspectives. There is an egocentric visual perspective and sense of directional movement, as well as a geocentric sense of up/down orientation based on gravity.

- Despite appearing disembodied, OBEs still involve a sense of self that is spatially located through these perspectives. There is a minimal embodied sense of occupying space and directing attention.

- OBEs demonstrate the distinction between experiencing one's body as a subject (the perceived) versus an object (the perceiver). The physical body seen from above is the body-as-object, while the felt point of perception is the body-as-subject. 

- OBEs are better described as experiences of altered embodiment rather than disembodiment, as there is still a sensed location of visual/vestibular awareness even when separate from the physical body viewed as an object.

 

The perspective discusses how virtual reality experiments have helped induce aspects of out-of-body experiences. One study had participants view a real-time video of their own back through goggles. When the virtual and real backs were touched simultaneously, participants felt the touch at the location of the virtual back. This showed vision dominating over touch sensation. Another study had participants view themselves from behind, while feeling touches to their real chest but seeing touches to a virtual chest. With synchronous touching, participants felt the touch at the virtual chest location and felt their self located behind their physical body. These studies demonstrate how manipulating visual perspective through virtual reality can influence multisensory integration and induce aspects of the dissociated self-location experienced in out-of-body experiences. The perspective discusses how this provides insight into the brain mechanisms underlying these altered states of embodiment.

 

- Researchers conducted experiments using virtual reality to manipulate subjects' sense of bodily self-awareness and self-location. This included distorting visual perspective and synchronizing visual and tactile stimulation. 

- Experiments found that vision dominates over other senses when there are conflicting cues. Participants experienced their self-location shifting toward the viewed location of tactile stimulation.

- In one study, stimulating the back versus chest caused self-location to shift downward or upward respectively, mirroring out-of-body experiences. Another study used brain imaging and found activity in the temporoparietal junction correlated with changes in self-location.

- These results support the idea that out-of-body experiences involve how the temporoparietal junction integrates sensory cues about the body and its orientation in space. 

- However, the experiments have not fully induced experiences reported by those who say they can voluntarily leave their body (astral projection). The debate centers on whether such experiences are fully illusory or could involve separating from the physical body.

 

- Researchers like Olaf Blanke, Susan Blackmore, and Thomas Metzinger take the view that out-of-body experiences (OBEs) can be explained through rigorous neuroscientific research, without needing to invoke paranormal explanations. The brain constructs a model of reality based on its assumptions. 

- The author agrees with this assessment, with the qualification that self-induced OBEs seem to differ from those induced artificially in ways not fully explained by current neuropsychological models. More research is needed.

- While OBEs can seem highly realistic, evidence for actually perceiving verifiable details from outside the physical body is lacking. Reports always include inaccuracies. Attempts to verify perceptions in controlled studies have not provided reliable evidence. 

- The impression of seeing during an OBE is likely similar to seeing in dreams - mental simulation rather than actual perception. Memory and cognitive maps are used to simulate seeing one's body and environment from an external perspective. Movement occurs in discrete jumps rather than continuously, as in dreams. In short, the world of OBEs seems to be one of imagination rather than verifiable external perception.

 

- Out-of-body experiences (OBEs) share many features with lucid dreams, such as occurring during sleep states conducive to dreaming and involving awareness of experiencing a dreamlike state. 

- Some OBEs appear to begin from hypnagogic/hypnopompic states between waking and sleeping, similar to how lucid dreams can occur. 

- OBEs and lucid dreams both often involve a high degree of vividness and control over the experience. 

- Phenomenologically, it can be difficult to distinguish between an OBE and a lucid dream from one's first-person perspective alone. 

- The possibility is raised that some OBEs may in fact be a subtype of lucid dream or closely related sleep phenomenon, given their numerous similarities in onset, content, and phenomenology. 

- Distinguishing between different states of consciousness like OBEs and dreams may require both first-person reports and third-person scientific perspectives like neuroscience.

So in summary, the passage discusses strong resemblances between OBEs and lucid dreams in how and when they occur based on first-person accounts, raising the possibility that some OBEs could be a type of lucid dream. Both perspectives are needed to fully understand these experiences.

 

The author discusses the sense of disorientation that can occur upon waking from a deep sleep. He describes how our consciousness normally retains a sense of the time and place we fell asleep, allowing us to orient ourselves upon waking. However, if we fall asleep in an unusual position or place, this can disrupt our usual retention of time and place. When waking in such a situation, we may be confused about the time or forget where we are momentarily. In more disrupted cases, we could mistakenly believe we slept months earlier or in a different country. The deepest kind of sleep allows the mind to relax entirely, letting go of any map of where we fell asleep. In such a case, upon waking in the night, we may not understand at first who we are or where we are located - all we have is a basic sense of existence, like an animal. It takes a moment for memory to allow us to reorient ourselves.

 

- The passage discusses whether we are conscious during deep sleep based on literary descriptions of waking from sleep. Proust and Transtömer depict memory returning to the self upon waking, like help from outside, implying it was lost during sleep. 

- This suggests there are two kinds of self-awareness - the immediate awareness of existing upon waking, and the autobiographical memory of one's narrative or story over time. Memory seems to reconstruct the narrative self from the outside.

- Yoga and Vedanta philosophies argue deep sleep involves a kind of awareness based on being able to remember feeling peaceful and unaware during sleep. Memory implies past conscious experiences leaving traces.

- Early Upanishads described deep sleep as either complete oblivion or a state of unknowing without cognitive content. Later Yoga texts fram it as a mode of non-cognitive consciousness lacking an object, analogous to the darkness having a felt presence.

- We feel this absence during sleep and remember it, showing deep sleep involves a kind of subliminal experience and consciousness, even without cognitive content or awareness of self as knower. It is classified as a fluctuation of consciousness rather than a stilled state.

 

- Deep sleep is considered a subliminal mode of awareness in some Indian philosophical traditions. The argument is that if there was no awareness at all, one would not be able to remember or recollect the quality of one's sleep. 

- Vyasa distinguishes between peaceful/refreshing sleep, disturbed/restless sleep, and dull/heavy sleep based on the mental impressions and memories left after waking.

- However, the stillness of consciousness achieved in deep sleep is different from the stillness achieved during meditation, which occurs in full awareness. In deep sleep, awareness is merely enveloped by darkness. 

- Deep sleep involves identifying with this enveloping darkness, rather than abiding as pure witnessing awareness. For this reason, it should be controlled and stilled like other cognitions during meditation practice.

- There is a debate around whether remembering sleep is actually a memory or an inference based on how one feels upon waking. The Nyaya school argues it is inference, while Advaita Vedanta argues it is a form of memory.

- The key issue is how one can know they did not know anything during deep sleep if there was no awareness or experience to remember. The debate focuses on the nature of ignorance or absence of knowledge in deep sleep.

 This passage discusses a philosophical debate surrounding consciousness in deep sleep. The key points are:

- The Naiyayikas school argues that consciousness ceases in deep sleep since the senses shut down and there are no means for knowledge. 

- Advaita Vedanta argues that one remembers having not known anything upon waking, so consciousness must have continued in some form of awareness of ignorance. 

- A core insight is that retrospective inference alone cannot account for the unified experience of being the same self who goes to sleep, wakes up, and recalls sleeping. There must be some retentional awareness.

- Advaita Vedanta proposes consciousness witnesses or is aware of the state of "not knowing" in deep sleep. This ignorant awareness is retained upon waking and recalled as memory. 

- Deep sleep involves an experience of "pure nonapprehension without misapprehension," akin to an awareness of total darkness or nothingness. 

- This amounts to a kind of "phenomenal consciousness" even if not "access consciousness" that can be mentally accessed during sleep itself. 

So in summary, the passage discusses differing philosophical views on whether consciousness continues or ceases in deep sleep, with Advaita Vedanta arguing for a type of awareness even in the state of pure ignorance.

 

- Advaita Vedanta and Yoga traditions consider that some form of awareness or consciousness is present even in dreamless sleep. This is called "witness consciousness" - a passive awareness that observes the states of waking, dreaming, and sleeping. 

- In dreamless sleep, the sense of ego or "I-ness" is not present according to Advaita Vedanta. Awareness is not attributed to an ego or self. It is more of a pure, non-conceptual witnessing.

- There is a debate between Yoga and Advaita Vedanta about the exact nature of awareness in dreamless sleep. Yoga sees it as a fluctuating state, while Advaita Vedanta argues the inner mental sense completely shuts down. 

- Neuroscience traditionally viewed consciousness as fading or disappearing in dreamless sleep based on people's inability to recall anything when woken from slow-wave sleep. But Indian philosophical views argue some form of awareness remains.

- These differing conceptions of dreamless sleep lead to interesting possibilities of mutual influence and new perspectives when combining Indian philosophy with neuroscience findings on sleep.

 

- Some neuroscientific studies find that when people are stimulated during deep sleep, the brain's response is localized and short-lived, unlike during waking where responses are complex and propagate over long distances. This is taken as evidence that "effective connectivity" and "large-scale integration" break down in deep sleep. 

- In deep sleep, cortical neurons alternate between "up" and "down" states. The up state is active like in waking, but instability leads to the down state, preventing long-distance communication. This is thought to undermine effective connectivity and large-scale integration.

- The integrated information theory holds that consciousness requires a system having many possible states available globally (integration of information). Deep sleep is proposed to have a drastic shrinkage of available states due to isolation of brain areas, indicating low or absent consciousness. 

- However, integrated information alone may not be sufficient for consciousness, as computers can have it without consciousness. And it does not distinguish phenomenal consciousness from intelligence/problem-solving. So its presence or absence does not definitively mark conscious vs unconscious states.

So in summary, some neuroscience findings are cited as evidence consciousness fades in deep sleep, but the case is not conclusive given issues with theories like integrated information theory. The possibility of ongoing phenomenal consciousness in deep sleep is not ruled out.

 

- Yoga and Vedanta differ in their views of consciousness in deep sleep. Yoga sees it as a state where cognitive activity and memory formation continues. Vedanta sees the inner mental sense shutting down completely in deep sleep. 

- Western sleep science shows unequivocally that memory processes are highly active in slow-wave sleep, promoting consolidation of new memories from earlier waking experiences. Experiments show reactivation of neural networks involved in memory formation during slow-wave sleep.

- Vedanta describes deep sleep as "seed sleep" - the causal source from which dreaming and waking consciousness arise. Neuroscience also supports the idea that deep sleep primes and shapes subsequent dream and waking states through memory replay and consolidation during slow-wave sleep. 

- Sleep can be seen as the brain's "default state" - a self-organized state to which it naturally returns after each waking period. This default state of sleep then influences how the waking brain functions and responds to the external world.

 

- Some perspectives from neuroscience and Indian philosophy (Yoga/Vedanta) both see deep sleep as the ground or source for waking consciousness. 

- However, the philosophical conceptions of deep sleep are more phenomenological and acknowledge cultural/contemplative variability, whereas neuroscience concepts are more physiological. 

- Yoga/Vedanta distinguish peaceful, disturbed, and heavy sleep based on the predominance of different 'strands' (gunas) of material nature - sattva, rajas, tamas respectively. Deep sleep in these traditions refers to a state free of mental activity and objects of awareness.

- Practices like yoga nidra aim to train the mind to witness lucidly the transition between waking and deep sleep in order to experience deep sleep as peaceful/blissful rather than dull. 

- Tibetan Buddhist 'sleep yoga' also aims to witness 'clear light sleep,' experiencing the subtle underlying awareness during deep sleep rather than identifying with senses/mind which shut down during deep sleep.

So in summary, both traditions see deep sleep as a mode of consciousness but with different phenomenological understandings informed by contemplative practices and experience, compared to neuroscience's physiological categorizations. Bridging these views requires accounting for cultural/phenomenological variability in sleep.

 Here is a summary of the key points about blissful from the passage:

- Tibetan Buddhist and Yoga/Vedanta descriptions of deep sleep describe it as having a "luminosity" or "clarity" that stems from pure awareness. This clarity is obscured by ignorance during regular sleep. 

- Practices like sleep yoga aim to recognize and experience this clarity/luminosity at the moment of falling asleep. It is described as being intensely bright but dense, like the sun through clouds. 

- At the moment of transition from wakefulness to sleep, pure awareness is said to shine clearly before dreams arise. Recognizing this through meditation can lead to experiencing deep sleep lucidly. 

- One can also enter a lucid deep sleep state from a lucid dream by dissolving the dream imagery completely and resting in awareness alone. 

- Descriptions of deep sleep share similarities with the state experienced at death, so sleep yoga is a practice for working with that experience as well. 

- A "contemplative sleep science" is needed to study states like lucid deep sleep through cooperation between scientists and contemplative traditions.

So in summary, "blissful" refers to the clear, luminous nature of pure awareness that is experienced during deep sleep according to certain contemplative traditions when obscured ignorance is purified.

 

- The passage describes a Being with Dying training program led by Joan Halifax to teach contemplative end-of-life care. It combines lectures, small group work, and meditation/yoga practices. 

- The goal is to help healthcare providers and dying individuals face death with mindfulness and compassion, whether one's own death or another's. 

- The author and her friend Rebecca, neither healthcare professionals, attend the 8-day program with about 60 other participants, mostly end-of-life care specialists experiencing burnout.

- On the first day, participants wrote about their worst and ideally preferred ways of dying. No one wanted to die in a hospital isolated from family/friends. Most wanted to die peacefully at home surrounded by loved ones. 

- The training aims to provide an experiential view of dying and death missing from the detached, objective view of biomedicine, drawing on contemplative perspectives from Buddhism and other traditions on death preparation and the dying process.

 

- The meditation is guiding the participants through a visualization of the dying process, based on the Tibetan Buddhist "Dissolution of the Elements After Death" practice. 

- In the visualization, the elements that make up the body and mind (earth, water, fire, air, space) are imagined to progressively dissolve one into the next, as they would during the natural dying process. 

- This is done to familiarize oneself with death and gain control over the mental states that may arise. It is meant to help transform the experience of dying into one of enlightenment and liberation. 

- During the guided meditation, the participants imagine their senses dimming and their grasp on the physical world loosening, as heavy, blurry feelings overtake the body and mind, representing the dissolution of the different elements. 

- The goal is to remain present and awake through this process, letting go of identification with the body and conceptual mind. It aims to help one accept and release into a vast open awareness at the time of death.

 

- The meditation guides the practitioner through a visualization of the death process, dissolving the bodily elements (water, fire, air, etc.) and senses. 

- The aim is to let go of identification with the body and experience a state of blankness/emptiness. 

- Visions may arise that are pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral - the practitioner is instructed not to identify with these.

- Breathing slows and stops as awareness withdraws inward. Death of the physical body is imagined.

- The final stage involves visualizing two light drops merging in the heart, freeing the mind from concepts. A clear light arises from emptiness. 

- This clear light state represents the Tibetan Buddhist understanding of death as a transition to an intermediate state before future rebirth, rather than complete cessation of experience. 

- The goal is to use meditation practice to cultivate non-attachment and open awareness in the face of death. This state of mind is then carried into daily living.

 

According to Tibetan Buddhist beliefs, when a person dies their consciousness begins to dissolve. First, thought processes slow down until reaching a "blackout" period of no awareness. 

Then, if the person has trained their mind through practices like meditation, they will experience the "clear light" - the ultimate nature of the mind which is said to resemble a bright, empty sky. This is seen as recognizing the true nature of reality.

If they have not trained their mind, they will remain unaware at this point. Their consciousness will then wander as a "mental body" in between lifetimes, seeking a new birth. 

Tibetan Buddhists see similarities between the dying process and falling asleep - as thought dissolves and consciousness changes states before emergence into dreams. This is meant to illustrate how training the mind through practices like dream yoga can help one remain aware during death.

However, some skepticism remains about how much can really be known about the direct experience of death. The Tibetan accounts cannot be conclusively proven or disproven. While experiences like clear light during meditation provide some analogy, death remains in the category of "extremely remote phenomena" only known through third-party testimony.

 

- Thukdam is a Tibetan Buddhist meditation practice where advanced practitioners are able to remain in a state of clear light awareness after clinical death, through consciously controlling the subtle consciousness and energy in the body. 

- The monk Jampa Thupten Tulku Rinpoche entered thukdam upon his medical certification of death on May 24, 2011. His body showed no signs of decay for 18 days while he remained in meditation. 

- Normally the clear light stage lasts only seconds or minutes for most people at death. But for highly practiced meditators, it can last days or weeks through thukdam meditation. 

- In thukdam, the subtle consciousness remains present in the body but the energetic aspect withdraws to the heart area. Practitioners may remain sitting or sleeping in meditation posture after death for some time.

- There are physical signs like retained flexibility, softness, warmth and glow that indicate one is still resting in the clear light ground luminosity state through thukdam meditation even after clinical death.

 

- In the Tibetan Buddhist tradition of thukdam, highly trained meditators are believed to remain in a state of clear light consciousness after physical death, before their body begins to decay. 

- Some cases of Tibetan monks have shown a delayed onset of decay after death, remaining in an upright sitting position for up to 3 weeks. However, a forensic pathologist noted this may be explainable by normal conditions like cool temperatures and an empty intestine.

- Scientists want to study meditators while alive to see if meditation can temporarily suspend metabolic activity and influence the dying process. One possibility is that lifetime practice could alter how the body decays after death. 

- While effects on the body could be shown, this would not confirm that consciousness remains present during thukdam. Consciousness may cease at death even if past meditation influences the decay process. 

- Studying thukdam could help revise models of death to include how the mind influences dying, as contemplative traditions say highly trained meditators can disengage from ego and watch its dissolution with equanimity at death.

 

Near-death experiences (NDEs) refer to profound experiences reported by people who were physiologically or psychologically close to death, such as during a cardiac arrest. Raymond Moody identified common elements of NDEs based on reported experiences. Later, Kenneth Ring developed a scale to measure the "depth" of NDEs based on certain features. Bruce Greyson also developed a scale to evaluate NDEs. 

Some key points about NDEs during cardiac arrest:

- Around 10% of cardiac arrest survivors report having an NDE, even though brain activity flatlines during cardiac arrest.

- NDE researchers claim these experiences challenge the view that consciousness depends on the brain, as people recall lucid experiences despite brain impairment. 

- However, the exact timing of NDEs during cardiac arrest is unknown. Reports only provide subjective sense of timing, not objective measurement. Experiences may occur just before or after flatlining. 

- It is debated whether people could have lucid experiences right before or after losing consciousness during cardiac arrest. More research is needed to better understand the relationship between NDEs, consciousness and brain activity during cardiac arrest.

 

- We have little information about the brain states associated with near-death experiences, as cardiac arrest is a medical emergency and no human EEG or neuroimaging data has been collected during the critical period when NDEs reportedly occur. 

- No studies have directly compared brain activity in cardiac arrest patients who do and do not report NDEs.

- The assertion that the EEG is flat during cardiac arrest is problematic, as it can take over 10 seconds for the EEG to show changes after the last heartbeat. Cardiac massage or defibrillation can restore EEG activity within 20 seconds.

- A recent rat study found heightened synchronized gamma activity in the brain after cardiac arrest, similar to patterns seen in human consciousness. This suggests the potential for cognitive processing during near-death states.

- A flat EEG does not necessarily mean a total loss of brain activity, as it mainly detects cortical activity and may miss subcortical or seizure activity. 

- Even the famous case of Pam Reynolds does not provide clear evidence of consciousness during complete cessation of brain activity, as parts of her NDE likely occurred before full cardiac arrest. 

- In summary, while we lack data, existing evidence suggests brain states conducive to conscious experiences like NDEs may still be possible briefly after clinical death begins. More research is needed.

 

- Pam Reynolds underwent brain surgery to remove an aneurysm. Her brain stem was paralyzed and her body cooled to reduce metabolism and brain activity. 

- She reported an out-of-body experience where she floated above the operating room and was able to recall details of the surgery accurately. However, the timing and details of her experience are unclear.

- Her account fits better with regained consciousness under anesthesia rather than veridical perception during clinical death with no brain activity. 

- Rigorously controlled studies have failed to find compelling evidence of veridical out-of-body perception during near-death experiences. 

- Neurophysiological models propose that near-death experiences are caused by "neural disinhibition" during situations of reduced oxygen or unstable brain activity, as in cardiac arrest or resuscitation. Hypoxia from situations like fainting can induce similar experiences.

- Not all cardiac arrest survivors report near-death experiences, so hypoxia alone cannot fully explain them. But it likely plays a role in the neural disruption that gives rise to the experience. More research is still needed.

 

The author outlines several flaws in the reasoning that near-death experiences can be fully explained by anoxia (lack of oxygen) to the brain during cardiac arrest. First, the study by van Lommel did not directly measure levels of anoxia, so it's unclear if patients experienced comparable anoxia. Second, the rate of anoxia onset may be more important than overall level - different rates could lead to different experiences. Third, anoxia affects individuals differently based on brain differences. Finally, memory ability may explain reporting differences. 

The author then discusses other likely contributors to near-death experiences besides anoxia: neurotransmitters like endorphins, altered temporal lobe functioning, and specific brain regions proposed in a model by Blanke and Dieguez. 

Finally, the author argues that near-death experiences cannot be reduced to simply true or false hallucinations, but must be understood from a first-person, existential perspective of drawing near one's own death and mortality. One's death experience will matter most in that moment, not any third-party assessment of its reality or meaning. Death ultimately remains a singular, ungraspable experience for each individual.

 

- Nāgārjuna criticizes two extreme views of the self - either it is a real, independent entity, or there is no self at all. He proposes a "middle way" - that the self is "dependently arisen." 

- If the self were the same as the conditions it depends on (the body and mental states), it would be impermanent like them. But if it was different, it couldn't have their characteristics. 

- Buddhist philosophy analyzes experience into five aggregates - form, feeling, perception, mental formations, and consciousness. These change moment to moment.

- If the self was the same as the aggregates, it would be impermanent. But it can't be separate from them, otherwise we couldn't know it or say it's "me."

- Nāgārjuna points out the flaws in proposing the self as either the same as or different from the ever-changing components of experience. His "middle way" is that there is no inherently existent or independent self, but only a process of dependent arising.

 

- Nāgārjuna argues that the self cannot be identified with either the aggregates (body and mind) or something separate from them. If identified with aggregates, it would change constantly; if separate, it would be unexperienced. 

- Some neuroscientists conclude there is no self at all, seeing that the brain offers no evidence of a substantial self. But Nāgārjuna rejects the notion that the self must be a substantially real thing.

- Nāgārjuna views the self as a dependently arisen series of mental and physical processes, rather than a thing or entity. We erroneously perceive the self as a unified, independently existing essence. 

- The author proposes understanding the self through the Buddhist concept of "I-making" - multiple levels of biological, psychological and social processes that constitute an experiential "I." 

- These "self-specifying systems" bring forth the relational distinction between self and other. The self is a process of "I-ing" rather than a substantial thing. This avoids the neuro-nihilist view that there is no self at all.

 

- The self or "I" emerges from the process of self-specification within a system or living being. 

- At the cellular level, self-specification occurs through autopoiesis - a living cell produces and maintains its own molecular components through internal chemical reactions, forming a boundary between itself and the external environment. 

- Higher life forms like bacteria engage in sense-making of the environment in order to survive. They detect chemicals and determine whether they are beneficial or harmful based on how it affects their lifestyle. This sense-making is directly embodied in their behavior. 

- Living beings exist in precarious conditions - they are continually affected by external factors like molecules buffeting them. They maintain coherence through strong/weak bonds internally and by mutually specifying each other's constituent processes as part of a self-perpetuating system. 

- The self emerges from these dynamic, relational processes of internal self-specification and external sense-making in relation to the environment for survival in precarious conditions. It is not a static entity but an ongoing process of "I-ing."

 

- Dependent arising occurs at three levels: causal, mereological (part-whole), and conceptual. 

- Causally, phenomena depend on multiple causes and conditions for their existence and cessation. 

- At the mereological level, a phenomenon depends on its parts, and in complex systems the parts also depend on the whole. 

- Conceptually, something's identity depends on how we conceptualize and refer to it through language and concepts. Our scale of observation also influences what we identify something as. 

- A nervous system develops in organisms to link sensory and motor activity in an ongoing, self-specifying way. This is done through sensorimotor cycles whereby sensing depends on movement and movement depends on sensing. 

- Sensorimotor integration in the brain distinguishes between self-caused sensory changes from one's own actions, versus externall caused changes from the environment. This allows sensing of oneself versus not-self.

 

- The sensorimotor cycle is self-specifying, meaning it enacts a sense of self that arises from the process of perceiving and acting, rather than pointing to a separate self. 

- The signals specific to an agent's own bodily actions (efference) become sensory signals (reafference) when actions produce feedback. Relating efference and reafference enacts a first-person perspective that distinguishes self from environment.

- This establishes a self/not-self distinction in perception and action without positing a self that is separate from the sensorimotor process. The sensorimotor cycle simultaneously constitutes the subject/agent and generates meaningful perception/action.

The key point is that the sensorimotor cycle self-specifies the first-person perspective in a way that intrinsically links perception, action, and sense of self, without requiring a separate, non-physical self entity.

 

- Francisco Varela engaged in a discussion with the Dalai Lama about whether single-celled organisms like bacteria could be considered sentient. 

- Varela said bacteria exhibit behaviors like seeking out nutrients (attractants) and avoiding toxins (repellents), similar to more complex organisms. However, he said there is no consciousness of pleasure or pain in bacteria.

- Varela distinguished between mere feelings like pleasure/pain (phenomenal consciousness) and cognitive awareness/recognition of those feelings (access consciousness). Bacteria likely do not have the latter.

- All living cells generate bioelectrical fields through ion flows across membranes. In multicellular organisms, specialized excitable cells like neurons generate neuroelectrical fields which become more complex in neuronal networks and brains. 

- From this perspective, evolution involves the emergence of increasingly complex self-organizing bioelectrical and neuroelectrical fields. Consciousness may arise from the synchronization of these fields in the brain. 

- Individual neurons sense their local electrochemical state through action potentials. The synchronization of many action potentials across the brain could produce the large-scale states associated with consciousness.

 

- Sentience depends on electrochemical processes in living cells, while consciousness depends on neuroelectrical processes in the brain. Consciousness arises from specific biological processes, not just computational properties. 

- Meditative practices may sensitize one to subtle experiences of bioelectrical fields in the body, and how these practices can alter electromagnetic brain and body processes. 

- Having an embodied subjective perspective is not enough to have a sense of self - one must also be able to attend to experiences and conceive of oneself as the subject. 

- Mirror self-recognition tests show some animals can recognize themselves, indicating cognitive abilities like social cognition, perspective-taking and empathy that relate to having a sense of self. 

- Joint attention between infants and caregivers leads to seeing oneself from an outside perspective, giving rise to a cognitive and emotional sense of being an individual "I" among others. This emerges from participating in social interactions that mutually specify each agent.

 

- Self-projection refers to the ability to mentally project oneself into alternative perspectives, such as remembering past events from one's own perspective or imagining future scenarios. 

- It involves representing oneself as both subject and object in mental simulations of time. This gives rise to a sense of personal identity and continuity of the self across time.

- Brain networks involved in self-projection overlap with the "default network" that is active during resting states and spontaneous thoughts. 

- Meditation can help disengage identification from the contents of self-related thoughts and projections, and experience awareness as a larger field in which thoughts arise.

- Repeated experience of getting lost in thought and "waking up" can lessen frequency of spontaneously arising thoughts and identification with the mentally represented "I".

- Changes to self-experience through meditation are linked to changes in neural networks involved in self-projection and self-related cognition, such as the default network.

 

- Researchers hypothesized that the default network would be active during mind wandering periods, while task-directed attentional networks would be active during awareness, shifting, and focusing periods during meditation. 

- fMRI scans supported this, showing default network activation during mind wandering and executive/salience network activation during shifting attention back to the breath and maintaining attention.

- Experienced meditators showed lower executive network activity when shifting attention, suggesting meditation practice requires less effort to disengage from mind wandering. 

- Another study compared brain activity in experienced vs novice meditators during different meditation types. Experienced meditators reported less mind wandering and showed less default network activation.

- A key study investigated the neural systems underlying present-moment embodied awareness vs narrative/autobiographical sense of self. MBSR training helped disengage from narrative self-focus and engage networks supporting embodied awareness. 

- Mindfulness training seems to allow more flexible shifting between narrative self-thinking and present-centered embodied awareness, by activating different neural systems. This suggests it's easier to disengage from narrative self-identification with meditation experience.

 

- According to Yogacara Buddhism, the sense of having a separate, independent self or "ego" is an illusion. This is called the illusion of self. 

- The illusion arises through a process called "self-designating". One part of the mental stream designates another part as the self. But since no part of the stream is truly a self, this is a mistaken designation.

- Yogacara explains this process using three aspects of consciousness - the "store consciousness" which contains latent dispositions and psychological tendencies, the "inner mental awareness" which direct attention to mental states, and the "preattentive mind" which provides a sense of being a conscious subject.

- When the inner awareness attends to a mental state, that state appears as belonging to the mental stream and feeling "mine". This is because the preattentive mind mistakenly designates the store consciousness as the self that owns the experiences.

- However, the store consciousness is just a changing process, not a substantial self. So experiencing the mental stream as belonging to a self is an error according to Yogacara, as there is no independent ego that exists. Thoughts referring to "I, me, mine" are never literally true.

- While agreeing the self is mentally constructed, the author argues this does not necessarily mean it is an illusion, as not all constructions are illusions. There is a basic sense of "mineness" of experience that is not delusional.

 Here are the key points about the self from the passage:

- There must be a pre-attentive, non-identifying way we experience the mental stream as "mine" for mental states to seem like mine. This is played by the pre-attentive mind in Yogacara philosophy. 

- This pre-attentive self-awareness generates "I-Me-Mine" thoughts, but these thoughts mistakenly refer to a substantial self. The pre-attentive awareness is of the mental stream, not of a self-entity.

- "I-Me-Mine" thinking only requires a notion of self as a subject/agent, not a substantially existent ego. This provides a legitimate notion of self without requiring a substantial entity. 

- In some meditative states, any sense of self may disappear, but this doesn't logically imply there is no self or that "I-Me-Mine" thoughts are always mistaken. 

- The word "I" functions performatively, to individuate and appropriate experiences, not referentially. It enacts a self through ongoing self-appropriating activity, rather than denoting an object.

- Candrakirti concludes the self is dependently arisen through mental construction and language, not that it has no existence at all like the nihilist view. The self exists dependent on causes and conditions.

So in summary, the self is a process of ongoing self-awareness and appropriation, not a substantial entity, but it still exists dependently through mental and linguistic designations rather than not at all.

 

- The dialogue between Yajnavalkya and King Janaka in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad seeks to understand the nature of consciousness. Yajnavalkya states that consciousness is not identical with any physical element or sense faculty. 

- When pressed further, Yajnavalkya identifies consciousness with pure awareness or the witnessing self (atman). The witnessing self is that which is aware of and illumines the processes of thinking, sensing, knowing, etc. but is distinct from those processes.

- Later Vedantic philosophy, particularly Advaita Vedanta, further develops the notion of the witnessing self/pure awareness as the fundamental and sole reality (brahman). All else is said to be dependent upon and illumined by brahman/consciousness. 

- While consciousness appears inherently subjective and private, the Upanisadic view identifies it with an impersonal, universal essence or ground of being. Consciousness is ultimately non-dual – it is one without a second.

- This perspective seeks to answer the "hard problem" of consciousness by identifying consciousness with brahman/atman, a ground that is entirely distinct from the physical realm yet grounds all experience.

- Several studies are cited that found meditation training can modify attention systems and improve perceptual discrimination, sustained attention, and self-regulation. Short-term meditation also improved attention. 

- One study found meditation altered perceptual rivalry in experienced Tibetan Buddhist monks. 

- Pure awareness or consciousness may exist independently of the brain and nervous system. Long-term meditators can induce high amplitude gamma synchrony during meditation, correlated with first-person reports. 

- The Dalai Lama has discussed consciousness with scientists and argues a scientific understanding need not conflict with Buddhist contemplative insights into mind and awareness. 

- Dzogchen and other traditions posit a basic or pure awareness that underlies ordinary experience and identities. This pure awareness may correspond to what science seeks as the fundamental entity or nature of mind. 

- The encounter between Buddhism and science is an ongoing discussion around whether Buddhist experiences tap into universal aspects of consciousness or are shaped by cultural and interpretive factors. Some argue Buddhism offers a unique "mind science."

- Western philosophers also debate whether consciousness is fundamentally primary or if it is dependent on cognitive accessibility and neural conditions. The relationship between awareness, experience and the brain remains an open topic.

 Here is a summary of the key points from the book Children’s Dreaming and the Development of Consciousness by David Foulkes:

- The book examines children's dreaming from infancy through adolescence and how it relates to the development of consciousness.

- It analyzes longitudinal studies that recorded the dreams of children from various ages via dream reports upon awakening. 

- Findings show that dreams in infancy tend to be disconnected images and sensations, becoming more narrative and incorporating social interactions from ages 3-5 years old.

- Between ages 6-12, dreams develop symbolism, imagination, problem-solving, and feelings of self-awareness within the dream state.

- Adolescence brings themes of independence, sexuality, and abstract philosophical thinking to dreams.

- The book argues that dreaming mirrors and contributes to cognitive, emotional, and social development during childhood. As consciousness expands with age, so too do the complexity and functions of dreams.

- Dreaming is proposed as a way for children to rehearse, experiment with, and integrate new experiences into their developing sense of self and reality.

So in summary, the book uses longitudinal dream research to examine how children's dreaming changes from infancy through adolescence and relates to the growth of their consciousness during development.

 Here is a summary of the section "6. IMAGINING: ARE WE REAL?" from the source text:

This section discusses dreaming as a form of imagination and considers whether dreaming reveals something fundamental about the nature of consciousness and reality. It references sources that discuss techniques for lucid dreaming and dream manipulation from both Western scientific and Tibetan Buddhist perspectives. It discusses evidence that parts of the brain involved in perception and movement are also active during dreaming. While the activation-synthesis model holds that dreams are generated internally by the brain, some sources cited propose dreams involve a form of perception or are modulated by the senses. The section considers philosophical views on dreaming as a type of imagination or hallucination. It references research showing brain areas involved in memory and future thinking are also involved in dreaming. In summarizing differing scientific perspectives, it discusses the idea that dreaming reveals consciousness does not fully depend on sensory inputs from the environment.

 Here is a summary of the main points from On First Philosophy in The Philosophical Writings of Descartes, Volume 2:

- Descartes introduces his work Meditations on First Philosophy by describing his aim to dismantle all his opinions and start with only what is indubitable. 

- He finds that the only indubitable proposition is "I am thinking, therefore I exist." Even senses can be doubted but thinking cannot, as to doubt one must think. 

- From this he establishes himself as a thinking, non-extended thing (i.e. mind or soul). The existence of material things is still in doubt at this point.

- In subsequent meditations he proves God's existence and that God would not deceive him. Therefore he can be certain of clear and distinct perceptions, such as the existence of material things. 

- He has thus established a foundation of certainty on which the sciences can be rebuilt from doubt. His method of hyperbolic doubt is meant to undermine assumptions and arrive at absolute certainty.

- The purpose of First Philosophy, or Metaphysics, is to achieve certain knowledge of God and the soul prior to studying other sciences. It provides the foundations for the sciences to be built upon.

 Here is a summary of the book sh by P. N. Mukerji (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1983):

- The book provides an in-depth examination of deep sleep (susupti) from the perspectives of different schools of Hindu philosophy, especially Advaita Vedanta. 

- It analyzes texts from the Upanishads, Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, commentaries of Shankara and others to understand their views on consciousness in deep sleep. 

- The key debate it focuses on is between the Advaita Vedanta position that consciousness persists in an undefiled state in deep sleep, versus the Nyaya position that there is no consciousness without cognition or awareness of objects. 

- It also explores how modern Western philosophers like Descartes, Locke and Leibniz approached the question of consciousness in dreamless sleep. 

- The book provides a rigorous philosophical analysis of primary texts to gain insights into one of the most challenging issues - that of the nature of consciousness when we are asleep without dreams. It is useful for understanding different perspectives in Hindu and Western philosophy on this topic.

 Here is a summary of the key points from the specified sections of Being with Dying:

- Halifax introduces the concept of "fearlessness in the presence of death" as a mental state that can be cultivated through contemplation and training. It involves letting go of attachment to conditioned states and accepting impermanence. 

- The Being with Dying training program aims to help healthcare professionals develop compassion and equipoise in working with dying patients. It teaches contemplative practices like mindfulness meditation to help participants directly experience impermanence.

- Participant Gordon Giddings wrote a book about his experience in the program and how it affected his work as a physician. 

- Halifax discusses specific contemplative exercises used in the training, like mindfulness of breath, to help participants experience the dissolving nature of the body and sensations. 

- Traditional Tibetan Buddhist practices for cultivating fearlessness in the face of death, like Change of Vision meditations, are discussed. Teachers explain how these practices can help one recognize the illusory nature of perceptions at the time of death.

- Stories of famous Tibetan lamas who demonstrated fearlessness through peaceful deaths that sometimes involved "thukdam" - maintaining a meditative state for days after breath and heartbeat cease - are provided.

 Here is a summary of the key points from vingstone, eds., The Limbic System: Functional Organization and Clinical Disorders (New York: Raven Press), 159–169, as reported in French, “Near-Death Experiences and the Brain”:

- The limbic system, located in the midbrain and telencephalon, regulates emotion, behavior and long-term memory. It includes structures like the hippocampus, amygdala and hypothalamus. 

- Under ischemic (lack of oxygen) or anoxic (lack of oxygen) conditions, the limbic system may be particularly vulnerable and its functioning altered. 

- During near-death experiences, activity in limbic structures like the hippocampus could produce profound alterations in emotion and memory formation, contributing to features of NDEs like life reviews. 

- Electrical instability in limbic regions during acute stress or oxygen deprivation may manifest as mystical or psychic experiences that the dying brain interprets as glimpses of the afterlife.

- The limbic system plays a role in generating a sense of self. Its dysfunction during acute stress or trauma could distort one's sense of identity and produce out-of-body perceptions during NDEs.

So in summary, it discusses how ischemia/anoxia affecting the limbic system, which regulates emotion, behavior and memory, may biomechanistically contribute to certain phenomenological aspects of near-death experiences.

 Here are brief summaries of the requested sources:

Thompson, Mind in Life, 46, 99: 

- Consciousness emerged through evolution as organisms grew more complex and developed the capacity for sensorimotor engagement with the environment. Life has an inherently sentient quality even at basic biological levels.

Thompson, Mind in Life, 46 discusses how basic organisms exhibit behaviors like attraction/aversion that indicate a basic form of awareness. P. 99 discusses how consciousness emerged gradually through biological evolution as organisms developed more complex brains and behaviors.

Dennett, Consciousness Explained (New York: Norton, 1984), 309–323:  

- Presents his multiple drafts model of consciousness, arguing that there is no single, definitive narrative of experiences that constitutes a Cartesian theater of consciousness. Instead, there are parallel processes of narrative construction occurring in the brain. The self is an illusion constructed through these processes.

The requested sections lay out Dennett's model wherein consciousness is an ongoing narrative construction in the brain, not a single definitive narrative. He argues the self is an illusion arising from these narrative processes rather than some inner entity.

 Here is a summary of Jonardon Ganeri's chapter "Self-Reference and Self-Awareness" from his book Identity, Cause, and Mind: Philosophical Essays:

The chapter examines the notion of self-reference and how it relates to self-awareness. Ganeri analyzes the idea that self-reference is a necessary condition for self-awareness. He looks at different conceptions of self from Indian philosophy traditions like Brahmanism, Buddhism, and Nyaya. 

Ganeri discusses the distinction between internal and external relations. For self-awareness, the relation of the self to itself must be internal or constitutive, not external or contingent. He considers the views of philosophers like Kant, Russell, and Casteneda on this topic. 

The chapter then turns to analyzing the Buddhist no-self doctrine. Ganeri explains how for Buddhists, there is no enduring self or soul, but only a flow of psychophysical events. There can be no intrinsic or internal relation of self to self on this view. However, Buddhists still acknowledge conventional or linguistic notions of persons.

In concluding, Ganeri argues that while self-reference may be necessary for self-awareness, the self that is aware need not be substantially real. The chapter aims to clarify different models of self and self-awareness across philosophical traditions. Overall, it provides an insightful analysis of this complex topic.

They find some increased skin temperature but no changes in core body temperature, casting doubt on more extreme reported effects. 

2. Kroeger et al. present evidence of organized brain activity in patients in extreme deep comas beyond the isoelectric line, challenging assumptions that this indicates a lack of organized cognition.

3. Krueger et al. propose that sleep is a fundamental property of neuronal networks in the brain, serving functions like memory processing and neuronal maintenance. 

4. LaBerge discusses lucid dreaming, the ability to realize one is dreaming while dreaming, summarizing research on induction techniques and physiological correlates. 

5. Kroeger et al. found patterns of brain activity in patients well beyond what was expected in deep comas, challenging assumptions about cognition in such states.

 Here is a summary of the article "Shifting Moods, Wandering Minds: Negative Moods Lead the Mind to Wander" by Killingsworth and Gilbert (2010):

This study examined how mood relates to mind-wandering. The researchers developed an iPhone app that randomly prompted participants to report their mood and whether their mind was wandering at that moment. Over 20,000 prompts from more than 2,000 participants were collected. 

The results showed that participants reported more mind-wandering when in a negative mood compared to a positive or neutral mood. Negative moods, such as feeling unhappy, sad, or stressed, were associated with a 14% increase in mind-wandering compared to positive moods.

The study provides evidence that mood impacts cognitive processes like attention and mind-wandering. When in a negative state, people are more likely to have task-unrelated thoughts drift into awareness. The findings suggest mood influences the contents and dynamics of inner mental experiences in everyday life. Overall, the study demonstrates a link between affective states and spontaneous cognition.

- Concepts of consciousness from India and Tibet include seeing consciousness as luminous and knowing. It is viewed as existing on a continuum of levels of awareness, from gross to subtle. Discrete moments of awareness are seen as interconnected. 

- In the Indian view, there are six types of consciousness associated with the six senses. Consciousness is seen as existing in three states - waking, dreaming, and deep sleep. The self is seen as dependent on name and form. 

- Western concepts focus more on the presence or absence of consciousness. They view deep sleep as a state without consciousness and dreams as delusional hallucinations. The self is seen by some as nonexistent or as transcending the brain. 

- Both traditions distinguish between waking and dreaming states, though India/Tibet see dreaming as a valid state and waking as potentially dream-like. 

- Deep sleep is viewed differently - India/Tibet see it as a state of subtle consciousness while the West lacks interest in it. 

- Meditation is seen in both traditions as a way to access subtle forms of consciousness like lucid dreaming or the clear light state during death. Neuroscience studies also investigate states like deep sleep.

- Other topics covered include out-of-body experiences, integration of awareness and embodiment, the wandering mind, social self-making, perspectives on consciousness and ignorance in philosophical traditions like Vedanta.

 Here is a summary of the key points about dreaming and related topics from the provided text:

- Dreams occur in all sleep stages, not just REM sleep. They can incorporate elements from waking life and memories. 

- Neuroscience views dreams as hallucinations resulting from brain activation during sleep. Other perspectives see dreams as meaningful or opportunities for insight.

- Lucid dreaming involves becoming consciously aware within a dream that one is dreaming. It allows control over dream characters and scenarios. 

- The hypnagogic state occurs during sleep onset and offsets. It can involve vivid, surreal imagery and insights. Out-of-body experiences sometimes occur in this state or in dreams.

- Dream yoga in Tibetan Buddhism aims to cultivate awareness during dreams in order to gain insights. It distinguishes ordinary from "lucid" or enlightening dreams. 

- Conceptions of self and consciousness are tested by dreaming experiences which lack normal waking sensory inputs and boundaries between inner and outer. This relates to philosophical debates on the nature of the mind-body relationship.

 Here is a summary of the key points from the provided text:

- Imagination and lucid dreaming are discussed in the context of Freud's work on dreams and understanding the mind. Lucid dreaming involves being aware that one is dreaming while the dream is occurring. 

- Intentionality refers to the "aboutness" or content of the mind and mental states. It is related to attention, volition, and daydreaming. In some Buddhist traditions it is considered a mental factor.

- Lucid dreaming research has utilized brain imaging studies to investigate neural correlates and understand how the brain and mind interact in this state. Techniques have been developed for inducing and maintaining lucid dreams. 

- Meditation practices can influence awareness, attention, and sleep patterns according to contemplative neuroscience research. Types of meditation discussed include focused attention, open monitoring, mindfulness, and dream yoga which involves lucid dreaming. 

- Memory plays a role in dreams, with different types of memory involved. The relationship between memory and consciousness in sleep, dreams, and waking states is complex. 

- Near-death experiences are discussed in relation to out-of-body experiences, perceptions of veridical information, timing in the dying process, and the challenge of understanding death experiences.

 

- Out-of-body experiences can occur as an altered state of consciousness where one experiences one's sense of self as being located outside of one's physical body. They are associated with anesthesia, near-death experiences, lucid dreaming, and meditative and hypnotic states.

- Neurologically, they have been linked to activity in brain regions involved in multisensory integration and own-body perception like the temporoparietal junction and precuneus. Electrical stimulation of these areas can induce OBE-like sensations. 

- Accounts of OBEs describe a vivid sense of being outside one's physical body while still sensing the environment. Observation of one's physical body from this extracorporeal perspective is commonly reported.

-Whether they represent actual disembodiment of consciousness or imaginative projections of the self is debated. Skeptics argue they reflect unusual neurological states, while some propose they offer evidence for survival of consciousness independent of the physical body.

- Different techniques like relaxation, meditation, and devices simulating out-of-body movement have been used to voluntarily induce milder OBE states for study, though full experiences are difficult to generate reliably in laboratory settings.

- A neurological explanation is that OBEs involve anomalies in multisensory integration and own-body perception related to brain regions involved in sense of self and bodily awareness. But a complete explanation of the unusual phenomenology remains elusive.

 Here is a summary of the key points about xvii; prereflective self-awareness, self, and related topics from the passage:

- Prereflective self-awareness refers to a basic self-awareness that occurs before conscious reflection. It is argued to exist at the level of 17-18 and 233. 

- Different views are discussed on the nature of the self, including it being dependently arisen, an independently real entity, nonexistent, a process/enacted, as a subject or object of awareness. 

- The self-designating error and self-designating systems refer to implicitly taking the self to be a real independent entity. 

- Discussion of self-illumination vs other-illumination of consciousness and factors like self-making cells, self-othering, self-projection, and sense of ownership. 

- Social self-making and the role of the temporoparietal junction and waking state are also mentioned in relation to notions of self. 

- The Yogacara school's views on self and how it relates to notions like consciousness, store consciousness, and substrate consciousness are briefly outlined.

 

- The passage discusses different states of consciousness, including waking, dreaming, deep sleep, hypnagogic states, and awareness. 

- It notes that consciousness can be distinguished from discrete moments of awareness, and that awareness can be enacted through imagination. 

- Dream states, lucid dreaming, false awakenings, and the hypnagogic state are mentioned in relation to distinguishing waking from sleeping. 

- Deep sleep state, yoga nidra, and notions from Yoga and Buddhist schools of philosophy regarding subtle consciousness and the dying process are referenced. 

- Witnessing without knowing, open awareness meditation, pure awareness, and distinguishing gross from subtle consciousness are touched on.
