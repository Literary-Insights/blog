 Here is a summary of the key points from the first chapter:

- The author argues that the future of business is "H2H" (Human to Human) rather than "B2B" or "B2C". The focus should be on connecting with customers on a human level.

- The ideas in the book come from the author's 20+ years of experience working with companies of all sizes across many industries. He provides real-world examples of how his philosophy has transformed businesses. 

- The author cautions readers not to immediately dismiss his ideas as unrealistic. The concepts have been successfully implemented in all types of companies selling diverse products/services.

- Case studies are provided showing how companies with less than 10 employees up to over 30,000 employees have used the 8 phases outlined in the book: Assess, Admit, Affirm, Activate, Acclimate, Accomplish, Adopt, Advocate.

- The author guarantees readers will find value in the book, offering a full refund at the end of the chapter. His goal is for readers to approach the ideas in the book with an open mind.

 

- The book outlines a framework for turning one-time purchasers into lifelong loyal customers. This involves moving customers through six phases: Assess, Admit, Affirm, Activate, Acclimate, and Accomplish.

- The techniques can work for any business, regardless of size, revenue, or whether they are B2B or B2C. 

- Case studies are provided covering small and large companies across many industries to demonstrate the concepts.

- The book emphasizes a "human-to-human" (H2H) approach, recognizing that all business is ultimately about interactions between people, not simply business-to-consumer or business-to-business transactions. 

- The author offers a full refund to anyone who disagrees with the human-to-human philosophy underlying the book's advice.

- The techniques aim to meet customers where they are emotionally and help move them through the ideal journey to lifelong loyalty.

 Here is a summary of the key points from the chapter:

- The author broke a tooth while eating candy and dreaded having to find a new dentist after moving to Denver. A friend recommended Dr. Katie McCann's dental practice, Aurora Modern Dentistry.

- The receptionist scheduled the author for an appointment just 2 hours later, showing great care and urgency in helping relieve his pain. The office also emailed him digital intake forms to complete, saving hassle and time. 

- Despite past negative dental experiences, the author was impressed by Dr. McCann's patient, thorough explanations and use of advanced technology to make a crown in just 1.5 hours. 

- The dental office anticipated the author's needs at every step, managing his emotions and offering payment plans, in-house insurance, and cost reductions. 

- Dr. McCann and her staff followed up with a call 2 hours after the procedure to check on pain levels. The receptionist offered Dr. McCann's personal cell phone number for any future questions or concerns.

- Overall, the remarkable customer service transformed the author's perception of dental care from a typically frustrating experience to an outstanding one, turning him into a loyal lifelong client.

 

- Businesses spend a lot of time and money acquiring new customers but very little on retaining them. As a result, they lose a huge number of customers soon after acquisition. 

- For example, 32% of new bank customers leave within a year, with 20% leaving without conducting a single transaction. 50% leave within the first 100 days.  

- This customer retention problem exists across industries. 21% of cellphone customers break contracts within 100 days. 60-70% of car owners never return to an auto shop after one bad experience. 

- The main reason customers leave is they feel neglected after the initial sale. Businesses focus heavily on the transaction but don't provide a remarkable ongoing experience.  

- Emotions and personal relationships are often deprioritized in business interactions. But emotional connections and remarkable experiences lead to customer loyalty.

- Losing customers is very costly - losing a customer means losing all their potential lifetime value. It's much more profitable to retain customers than constantly acquire new ones.

- Businesses need to focus more on customer retention, building emotional connections, and creating remarkable experiences after the sale. This will reduce customer churn and increase loyalty and lifetime value.

 

- Businesses focus on acquiring new customers but don't put enough effort into retaining existing customers once the sale is made. The excitement and courting ends once the prospect becomes a customer. 

- Companies reward and promote employees focused on sales and marketing over those working on customer retention. Far more resources are devoted to acquiring versus retaining customers.

- Customer service and account management roles are marginalized and seen as less important. These employees have less status and influence in most organizations. 

- As a result of these structural and cultural issues, new customers often feel neglected and unimportant once they buy. This leads to rapid customer defection and loss of business. Companies need to shift their focus to improving the post-purchase customer experience and retaining existing clients.

 Here is a summary of the key points about the financial impact of a bad customer experience:

- Losing a customer costs a business far more than just the lost revenue. There are sunk costs in acquisition, decreased overall profits, damage to team morale, and forgotten lessons. 

- Improving customer retention by just 5% can increase profits by 25-100%, according to research by Frederick Reichheld. This is because the cost of acquiring new customers is very high compared to retaining existing ones.

- It is 6-7 times more expensive to acquire a new customer than retain an existing one. Focusing on the customer experience and retention is more efficient and effective.

- Loyal customers have a lifetime value over 10 times their initial purchase. Customer loyalty compounds over time like money left in the bank.

- Customers are more likely to spend more with companies that provide excellent service - up to 9 out of 10 customers say they would pay more for a superior experience.

- Trends show companies with lower customer churn rates have significantly higher valuations over time due to the compounding effect of retention.

- In summary, losing customers has a huge financial impact in both direct costs and lost future revenue. Improving retention provides exponential returns over time.

 

- In the 1970s-1980s, businesses could differentiate by having zero defects in their products. 

- In the 1990s, customization was a way to differentiate.

- In the 2000s-2010s, low pricing was a differentiator, but this waned as pricing became very competitive. 

- Also in the 2000s-2010s, being accessible 24/7/365 differentiated businesses, but this quickly became the norm as every business came "online."

- Now, with quality, customization, low pricing, and accessibility as the standard, the only way left for businesses to differentiate is through customer experience. 

- Customer service is reactive, while customer experience is proactive. Customer experience encompasses the emotions a customer feels when interacting with a product/service.

- Creating "raving fans" through good experiences is important, but most businesses overestimate how many raving fans they actually have. 

- Businesses know customer experience is important, but most don't know what actions to take to improve it.

- The "First 100 Days" after a sale are critical for securing customer loyalty through positive interactions and delivering value.

- Customers form opinions quickly, so businesses must focus on creating remarkable experiences right from the start.

 

- The first 100 days of a customer relationship are critical for establishing trust and rapport. A consistent, systematic approach over this time period is necessary. 

- Customers go through 8 phases in their first 100 days: 

1. Assess - The customer evaluates if your business can fulfill their needs. 

2. Admit - The customer admits they have a problem and buys your product/service. 

3. Affirm - The customer may experience doubt about their purchase (buyer's remorse). You must reaffirm their decision.

4. Activate - The first major interaction kicks off the relationship. You must activate it in a meaningful way. 

5. Acclimate - The customer learns your processes. You must properly onboard them.

6. Accomplish - The customer achieves their desired outcome by using your product/service. 

7. Adopt - The customer takes ownership of the relationship and becomes a loyal advocate. 

8. Advocate - The customer actively promotes you and becomes a raving fan.

- Guiding customers through all 8 phases leads to loyal, raving fans. Most businesses fall short between phases 4-6.

- This 8 phase model works for all businesses, no matter size or industry. The customer journey is consistent.

 

- There are 8 phases of the customer experience: Suspect, Prospect, Lead, Customer, Client, Loyalist, Advocate, Customer for Life. 

- Moving customers through the phases leads to greater loyalty and advocacy. Letting customers get stuck or revert backwards can cause them to exit.

- There are 6 mediums for communicating with customers in each phase: in-person, email, mail, phone, video, presents. Each creates a different emotional experience.

- In-person communication builds the strongest rapport and understanding. Email is ubiquitous but causes overwhelm. Mail stands out. Phone/text fosters immediate connection. Video can be informal yet impactful. Presents should be meaningful, not marketing ploys. 

- Applying the phases and communication mediums together creates a remarkable customer experience. Most businesses use only 2-3 mediums currently. There is room for improvement in mapping out the customer journey.

- The goal is to guide each customer through the phases, using the right mediums at the right times, to turn them into raving fans and advocates. This leads to sustainable growth.

 Here is a summary of the key points about interacting with customers in the Assess phase:

- The Assess phase is when the customer is deciding if they want to do business with you. They are learning about your organization and assessing if you can meet their needs. 

- Connect with customers during this phase on a personal level. Find common interests to build rapport. 

- Provide value even before the sale. Give samples or small gestures that show you care about their needs.

- Going above and beyond to delight customers takes little extra effort but pays off with increased loyalty and referrals. 

- Solve customers' problems and provide value rather than just focusing on the sale. Understand their situation and tailor your solution.

- Build trust by being dependable, transparent, and keeping your word. Reliability builds confidence in your ability to deliver.

- Adjust your offerings to the customer's specific needs. Customization shows you care about their unique situation.

- Clearly communicate how you will improve their situation. Demonstrate with facts/data how you can help.

- Make the experience frictionless and easy. Remove obstacles so they can focus on assessing your solution.

- Follow up and continue to nurture leads. The assess phase often takes time, requiring an ongoing relationship.

 

- Customers assess a product or service both rationally and emotionally before deciding to purchase. They want to know how they'll be treated after the sale when they no longer have leverage.

- Marketing and sales teams often fail to address the post-purchase customer experience during the sales process. They focus on making the sale rather than setting proper expectations. 

- Salespeople are incentivized to make sales, not retain customers long-term. The handoff to account management after the sale is often rocky.

- Salespeople should "preframe" the customer experience by explaining and demonstrating what interactions will be like post-sale. This sets proper expectations.

- Small touches that demonstrate attention to detail during the sales process signal that this level of care will continue after the sale.

- The entire organization, not just sales, needs to shift focus to the entire customer journey, not just the sale. This creates a smooth transition to account management.

 

- The author attended a seminar hosted by Wealth Factory. Before it started, the founder brought the author a six-pack of root beer because he had learned it was the author's favorite drink. 

- This gesture built rapport and showed that Wealth Factory cares about clients as individuals. Even though it was a small thing, it made the author a fan.

- Salespeople should focus on building long-term relationships, not just closing sales. Doing "homework" to learn clients' interests and tailor experiences to them is key.

- "Preframing" gives prospects a taste of being a client. Small personalized touches make people feel special. This can be systematized across a business. 

- Creating emotional connections doesn't have to be expensive. Thoughtfulness matters more than cost. Employees can be taught to "wow" customers by experiencing it themselves first.

- Customers want to feel special, important, and that they matter. Consistently making them feel this way leads to long-term loyalty.

- Personal details collected early on can be used to personalize later communications once a prospect becomes a customer. This shows impressive recall and care.

 Here is a summary of the key points about goals from the passage:

- The author signed up for inspirational emails from "The Universe" and mentioned in the questionnaire that a personal goal was to be on the cover of Time magazine someday. 

- Months later, the author received an email referencing this goal, making them feel heard and understood. Even though it was automated, it felt personalized. 

- This demonstrates that asking customers questions and then circling back to their answers later makes interactions feel more meaningful. 

- However, failing to deliver on expectations set during the sales process (the "Assess" phase) negatively impacts the customer experience. 

- The author had a poor insurance claim experience because the salesperson didn't properly set expectations or communicate their policy needs.

- It's important for salespeople to accurately convey offerings and communicate customer desires so expectations are properly set. Failing to do this results in bad experiences when problems arise.

 

- The Admit phase begins when a prospect admits they have a problem/need and believes your company can solve it, leading them to decide to become a customer. 

- The first interaction when a prospect becomes a customer heavily influences their perception of your company. Make it remarkable.

- Overwhelm new customers with positive emotions by stuffing their first experience full of "wow" moments. Go above and beyond.

- The beginning sets the tone. If you delight new customers upfront, they'll likely remain loyal longer.

- Tools to enhance the Admit phase: in-person, email, mail, phone, video, present. Use them creatively to wow new customers.

- Evaluate your current Admit phase experience and identify ways to improve it. Choose one idea to implement immediately that will positively impact the customer journey.

- The Admit phase sets up how customers will experience the rest of their journey with your company. Deliver an exceptional first impression.

 

- Kids love stuffed animals. This is evident from the popularity of stores like Build-A-Bear where kids can create their own custom stuffed animals. The hands-on process creates a sense of pride and ownership. 

- The Admit phase starts when a customer makes a purchase. At this point, the customer transitions from skeptical to excited as dopamine floods their brain. 

- Most businesses celebrate landing a new customer internally but don't join the customer in their excitement. This is a missed opportunity to align emotions and strengthen the new relationship.

- Some companies, especially toy companies, are good at celebrating with the customer at the point of purchase. Ridemakerz is an example where kids get to customize their own toy car and employees applaud and celebrate the "birth" of the new vehicle.

- Creating a shared experience and memorializing the purchase moment aligns the customer's excitement with the company's excitement. This sends a positive message and strengthens the new relationship right from the start.

 

- Zogics, a fitness equipment company, goes above and beyond to delight new customers in the "Admit" phase. 

- They send a personalized video email confirmation with the employee holding up a "Thank You" sign addressed to the customer. This results in very high open and video watch rates.

- The packaging the products arrive in is playful and engaging, with messages printed on the box and a lollipop inside. 

- This focus on customer experience early on sets the tone for future positive interactions. The company has fun coming up with creative ideas to surprise and delight new customers.

- The Admit phase is critical for laying the groundwork for an ongoing positive relationship between the company and customer. Zogics leverages this phase very effectively.

 Here are the key points from the passage:

- Use playfulness, humor, and surprises to make the customer experience remarkable. This shows customers your company's culture and makes them feel part of something bigger. 

- Mark new customer entry points with rituals and meaning. This transforms customers from "before" to "after" and shows how your product/service changes their life.

- Build connections between new and existing customers early on. This creates a sense of community and belonging.  

- Match (but don't exceed) the new customer's enthusiasm. Celebrate their decision appropriately, but don't go overboard too early. 

- Make the admission process easy and frictionless. Remove barriers and distractions to focus on the customer.

- Give customers a peek behind the curtain. Let them see how your company really operates.

- Make them insiders with access and knowledge others don't have. This makes them feel special.

- Set expectations clearly to avoid future misunderstandings.

- Lay the groundwork for the next phase of the customer journey.

 

- The Admit phase is when the customer hands over money and makes a purchase. They admit they have a problem the business can solve. 

- The customer feels hope and excitement about the potential results. Their brain releases dopamine, giving them an energy high.

- Businesses should capitalize on this excitement and exceed expectations as the relationship begins.

- Ideas for the Admit phase: in-person celebrations, personalized thank you emails, handwritten notes, phone calls, welcome videos, thoughtful gifts.

- The goal is to start the relationship off right and make the customer feel special. Memoralize the transition from prospect to customer.

- After the high of Admit comes the Affirm phase, where customers may feel fear, doubt and buyer's remorse. 

- Businesses must reassure customers and keep their confidence high, especially when shifting between online and offline interactions.

- The company Total Debt Freedom builds confidence by connecting personally and recognizing customers as human beings, not numbers. They focus on identifying needs and setting expectations upfront.

The key is to celebrate the new relationship in the Admit phase, then affirm the customer's choice and reassure them in the Affirm phase.

 

- After making a purchase, customers often experience buyer's remorse due to decreasing dopamine levels. This leads to doubts and uncertainty about their decision. 

- Companies typically do little to counter these feelings, leaving the customer feeling isolated. This can diminish confidence in the company.

- To combat buyer's remorse, companies should quickly provide affirmation that the customer made the right choice. This reaffirms the decision and reassures the customer.

- The author gives an example from his own experience working with Book in a Box to write this book. Initially excited, he soon experienced buyer's remorse but was reassured through regular check-ins and affirmation from the Book in a Box team.

- Key takeaway: Providing quick affirmation of the customer's purchase decision helps counter buyer's remorse and maintains confidence in the company.

 Here are the key points from the passage:

- Buyer's remorse is a common feeling after making a big purchase. Customers may start to doubt their decision and pull away. 

- Businesses should anticipate this emotional rollercoaster and have strategies to counter negative emotions. This could include checking in with the customer, validating their feelings, building trust, and providing reassurance.

- Book in a Box handles buyer's remorse by adding celebration elements after a sale, directly addressing any doubts on the first call, and referring back to allay fears.

- CD Baby's founder reinvented the standard order confirmation email into an entertaining narrative that made customers smile instead of worry. 

- The concept of "making the required remarkable" means taking mundane business necessities and infusing them with creativity, surprise, and delight. This is an effective way to combat buyer's remorse.

- Remarkable required elements get people talking and are a great marketing tool. CD Baby's confirmation email became famous and was widely discussed online.

The key is to anticipate the customer's emotional journey and have touchpoints ready to guide them through the affirmation phase confidently. Bringing creativity to required elements is an opportunity to do this.

 

- To counter buyer's remorse, confirm the purchase quickly and accurately to reassure customers that everything is on schedule. 

- Offering a money-back guarantee eliminates fears of losing money or being committed long-term. Generous return policies (e.g. Lands' End) build trust and loyalty.

- Having enthusiastic veteran customers make welcome calls to new customers provides credible affirmation of the benefits of membership. 

- Surprising new customers with small gifts or perks (e.g. CADRE sending books) delights them and reinforces the value of the purchase.

- The Affirm phase begins after purchase and before major interaction with the product/service. It's critical to mitigate buyer's remorse in this "quiet zone" through confirmation and perceived value to ensure customer satisfaction.

 

- The Affirm phase is when the business has the opportunity to counter any buyer's remorse and reinforce the customer's purchase decision. 

- There are six strategies to use in the Affirm phase:

1. In-person interactions to reassure the customer. 

2. Emails to show you are working behind the scenes.  

3. Mail pieces to calm any fears or doubts.

4. Phone calls to convey excitement about the new business. 

5. Videos to reassure the customer they will get what they hoped for. 

6. Gifts and surprises to delight the customer.

- The goal is to make the customer feel confident and assured they made the right purchase decision. This phase is critical to mitigate any buyer's remorse before delivering the product/service.

 

- The "activation" phase is the first major interaction a customer has with a product or service after purchase. It's a critical moment to impress customers and avoid buyer's remorse. 

- Companies should remove any barriers to customers immediately enjoying their purchase. Apple shipping pre-charged iPods is a good example.

- Personalized, tailored digital experiences and "shock and awe" surprise mailings can make first impressions remarkable. 

- Products and instructions should be designed to make initial interactions easy, unintimidating and accessible to avoid errors. 23andMe's genetic testing kit is a good example.

- Unexpected moments of delight during early interactions create positive impressions. Cornerstone's handwritten notes and L'Occitane's botanical workshops do this well.

- The beginning of the customer relationship sets the tone. A strong first impression leads to engaged, loyal customers.

 Here is a summary of the key points about the Activate phase:

- The Activate phase occurs when the customer first receives or engages with the product or service they purchased. 

- This first impression sets the tone for the relationship and creates an emotional baseline. Customers closely engage with any packaging, inserts, etc. 

- Bring energy and intention to "activate" the relationship and create a remarkable experience. Use this phase to set the standard for future interactions.

- In-person interactions should be positive, high-energy, and focused on connection and hospitality.

- Emails should address the customer's emotional state and provide clear instructions on getting started. Customization creates a feeling of care.

- Mail can include process maps, checklists, enhanced packaging, and unexpected gifts to make a powerful first impression. 

- Follow-up phone calls confirm receipt, check on progress, and allow for fast resolution of any issues.

- Personalized videos bring a "wow" moment with a human face to the first interaction.

- Include something unexpected like a sample product, sneak peek, or free tool to delight the customer.

- The key is to make the first impression positive, remarkable, and customized to reinforce the relationship.

 Here is a summary of the key points about the Acclimate phase:

The Acclimate phase is when the customer learns how the organization does business and gets familiar with the various interactions. Companies often assume customers already know their processes, but new customers need more guidance than expected. 

Organizations should slow down and assist customers in getting comfortable with the new environment, people, processes, and systems. The goal is to make customers feel at ease with how the business operates.

Companies should explain each step in the process, why it's important, and what comes next. Pull back the curtain and guide customers through the full experience. This helps set proper expectations and prevent surprises.

Assess where your customer currently stands and recognize it may be far behind where you think they are. Bridge this gap by over-communicating and giving extra assistance during this phase. 

Look for ways to give customers visibility into behind-the-scenes operations. The more you educate them on how you do business, the faster they will acclimate.

Overall, the Acclimate phase is about ensuring a smooth transition for customers into the new relationship so they feel comfortable, informed, and ready to move forward.

 

- Customers want frequent communication and updates throughout a process or project, even on small accomplishments along the way. This reduces uncertainty and dissatisfaction. 

- Don't assume a silent customer is a satisfied customer. Lack of complaints can mean growing disconnect and dissatisfaction. Proactively communicate at key milestones.

- Provide an easy-to-understand visual "map" outlining the full process and where the customer currently is. This brings clarity and confidence.

- Simplify and visualize even complex processes to make them easy for customers to follow. Use creative formats like a puzzle with milestone pieces. 

- Guide the customer step-by-step through the full process. Regular communication and celebrations of progress build satisfaction and loyalty.

In summary, proactive communication, celebration of milestones, and visual guides eliminate uncertainty and foster satisfied, loyal customers even during lengthy and complex engagements.

 Here are a few key takeaways from the examples:

- Break down complex processes into simple, visual steps to help customers understand and follow along. For example, PolicyMedical uses an "implementation puzzle" to outline the onboarding process. 

- Introduce your own lingo and terminology early so customers feel included. San Francisco CrossFit teaches new members the unique CrossFit language like "WOD" and "RX" during onboarding.

- Pair new customers with helpful, patient employees who can guide them through the initial encounters. San Francisco CrossFit matches intro trainees with coaches based on personality fit. 

- Create opportunities for community bonding, like social events. This helps new customers make connections and relationships.

- Proactively communicate to alleviate moments of anxiety. Delta letting customers know their bags were loaded is a small touch that reduces stress.

- Have a structured onboarding program like San Francisco CrossFit's multi-step intro sessions. This systematically acclimates new customers.

- Measure success rates of onboarding processes to optimize over time. San Francisco CrossFit tracks how many intro series participants convert to members.

The key is to guide your customers through the initial relationship-building interactions, ease any points of anxiety or confusion, and make them feel like part of the community right away. This leads to better retention and loyalty.

 Here is a summary of key points about creating remarkable customer experiences in the Acclimate phase:

- The Acclimate phase occurs after the first major interaction but before the customer accomplishes their original goal in purchasing or using your product/service. 

- The goals are to get early buy-in and habit formation before novelty wears off or old behaviors resurface. 

- This is the opportunity to introduce customers to your organization's culture, processes, systems to help them adapt.

- In-person interactions like teaching "language", walking through processes, and celebrating milestones can smooth the transition. 

- Emails for regular check-ins, surveys, status updates, and congratulations on achievements keep communication fluid.

- Mailed gifts, guides, or welcome packages make customers feel special. 

- Phone/video conversations for personalized orientations acclimate customers.

- Website portals, knowledge bases, FAQs help customers learn independently. 

- Social posts welcoming new customers and highlighting their early achievements.

- Reviews requesting feedback identify areas for improvement.

- Analytics track customer behavior for proactive assistance.

The key is guiding customers through acclimation for early buy-in and habit formation before novelty wears off or old behaviors return. Personalized assistance and celebrations smooth the transition.

 Here are the key ideas for enhancing the customer experience during the Accomplish phase:

Overview
- The Accomplish phase occurs when the customer achieves the result they sought in working with you. Unfortunately, many customers never reach this phase. 

Case Study 
- Ongoing Operations celebrates when customers complete their disaster recovery implementation by sending a custom cake. This unexpected gift acknowledges the milestone and strengthens the relationship.

Key Takeaway
- Know the customer's primary goal and celebrate when they achieve it. Invest at least 5% of project profits into experience enhancements.

Ideas for the Accomplish Phase
- Send a personalized video congratulating the customer on their accomplishment.
- Host an event to recognize the achievement.
- Give an unexpected gift like Ongoing Operations' cake. 
- Showcase the customer's success in your marketing.
- Ask for a testimonial to help promote future business.

The Accomplish phase is essential for customer retention. Taking time to celebrate achievements shows you care and strengthens loyalty. Even small gestures can make a lasting impact.

 

- Reaching the "Accomplish" phase, where the customer achieves their desired result, is critical yet often overlooked. Most customer interactions fall into 3 categories: Mission Accomplished, The Lukewarm Bath, or Mission Failure.  

- After hearing a speech, Jon Goodman revamped his online training program's customer experience. He incorporated offline elements like textbooks and workbooks to surprise customers and stand out. 

- When students complete the program, Jon further surprises them by sending a framed graduation diploma, like those from traditional in-person programs. This delights customers and employees.  

- Jon's customized customer experience yields high course completion rates (60% vs an industry average of 3-5%) and extremely low refund rates (2.9% vs a 20% average). This positively impacts revenue.

- The "Accomplish" phase ties directly to the company's core promise. To excel here, businesses should track if customers achieve their goals, celebrate achievements, and focus on accelerating through the finish line rather than slowing at the tape.

 

- Help customers achieve their ultimate goal, not just the immediate result they are looking for. Understand the deeper motivation behind their goal. 

- Send a confirmation email or message after the customer achieves their goal, timed properly so they have already accomplished it. Personalize and automate where possible.

- The confirmation should celebrate their achievement and can include an upsell offer if well-timed. This significantly increases likelihood of another purchase.

- When launching a website, clearly define goals and success metrics upfront with the client. Celebrate the launch through press releases and social media. 

- Conduct internal and external surveys after the website launch to get feedback from your team and the client. Use this to improve future work and show appreciation to the client.

- Make the external client survey lighthearted and human. Let them vent frustration but end on a positive note thanking them and offering to "hug it out." This maintains the relationship for future work.

The key ideas are to understand the customer's real goal, celebrate their achievements, get feedback after project completion, and maintain a positive tone even when things don't go perfectly. The focus is on helping the customer accomplish their ultimate desire and continuing the relationship into the future.

 

- Yoko Co implemented onboarding strategies to improve client and employee satisfaction. This included kickoff meetings to align on goals and success metrics, regular check-ins, and conclusion meetings to review results. 

- For clients, they now send pre-project and post-project surveys to gather feedback. The surveys expand based on the client's rating, allowing clients to elaborate on positive or negative experiences. 

- Internally, they do pre-project and post-project surveys to get employee perspectives. 

- These strategies have increased collaboration, engagement, and excitement among employees. It has also led to happier, more satisfied clients who are more likely to provide testimonials.

- By collaborating upfront on goals and checking in throughout the project, Yoko Co ensures the "finish line" is clear for both their team and the client. Surveying at the end confirms whether the finish line has been crossed.

- The key takeaway is to establish metrics early, check-in regularly, and survey at the end to align on whether the engagement was successful for both the customer and your employees. This leads to better experiences for all.

 Here are my responses to the assignment questions on enhancing the customer experience during the Accomplish phase:

Evaluating the Current Situation

What is the goal your customer is trying to reach? 

The goal my customers are trying to reach is successfully completing a project or task using my product or service. They want to accomplish their objectives efficiently and effectively. I need to better understand if my customers feel they have achieved their goals when working with me. I could send a survey at the end of each project to get feedback on whether their goals were met.

I estimate about 70% of my customers accomplish their goals when using my products/services. I am not currently tracking this closely enough to have an accurate percentage. 

In my current business, I do not create remarkable experiences in the Accomplish phase. I simply deliver the project or service without much celebration when it is complete. 

On a scale of 1-10, I would rate my current Accomplish phase experience a 4. There is significant room for improvement in acknowledging accomplishments.

Tools to Enhance the Future Experience

In-Person: Host a celebration dinner or event when a major milestone or project is completed to mark the accomplishment. 

Email: Send a congratulatory email highlighting major milestones and goals achieved on a project. Include a certificate of completion.

Mail: Send a handwritten congratulations note when a project finishes significant milestones. 

Phone: Call customers when big milestones are completed to congratulate them and celebrate the achievement.

Video: Create a short congratulatory video from team members when a customer completes a large project.

Present: Give customers a gift basket or bonus item when reaching a major accomplishment working with us.

 Here are a few key points from the section:

- Apple customers demonstrate strong loyalty and commitment, lining up for new product releases even before knowing details. This shows a high level of adoption of the Apple brand.

- Apple differentiated itself with white earbuds starting in 2001 with the iPod. This gave a visual marker of Apple product adoption. 

- The prevalence of white earbuds led to increased robberies, as thieves knew people with white earbuds likely had an expensive device. This shows the strong association between the white earbuds and Apple loyalty.

- With the release of AirPods in 2016, Apple loyalists could be identified by the white wireless earbuds sticking out of their ears, continuing the visual marker of Apple adoption.

In summary, Apple created visual markers like white earbuds that clearly identified their most loyal, adopted customers. This highlights the fanaticism of Apple's base and their commitment to the brand.

 

- Apple's wireless AirPods caught people's attention when first released, demonstrating how eye-catching design can make a product trendy and ubiquitous. 

- Harley-Davidson has built extreme loyalty among riders who get tattoos of the logo, associating the brand with a desirable lifestyle and community.

- Lady Gaga focuses efforts on superfans, builds a community among them, and gives them an identifying name ("Little Monsters") to make them feel they belong.

- DōTERRA, a multilevel marketing essential oils company, retains customers at rates far above industry averages by rewarding loyalty with free gifts and a points program.

- The main takeaway is that brands can inspire great loyalty if they make customers feel part of a community, give them ways to show affiliation, and reward their ongoing commitment. Loyalty goes beyond a transactional relationship to a feeling of belonging.

 

- Offer free, high-quality products or services to existing customers to excite them and encourage loyalty. This will make them feel special and incentivize repeat business. 

- Create exclusive, memorable experiences for your best customers as a reward for their loyalty. This could include VIP access to events, unique memorabilia, or personalized gifts. 

- Find creative ways to surprise and delight your top customers. Personalize gifts and experiences to show you appreciate them. Make them feel like part of an exclusive club.

- Don't be afraid to go above and beyond for your loyal advocates. The more you wow them, the more likely they are to sing your praises.

- Cultivate true relationships with customers and understand their interests. Demonstrate you care about them as individuals, not just transactions.

- Make your most loyal fans feel appreciated. Look for opportunities to create joy and excitement. A little creativity and thoughtfulness can go a long way.

The key is to focus energy on delighting those who already love you rather than starting from scratch with new customers. Loyalty has its privileges, so make sure your VIPs feel special.

 Here are a few ideas for creating remarkable customer experiences in the Advocate phase:

- Create a formal ambassador or advocate program that gives loyal customers special titles, access, and rewards for referrals. Make them feel like VIPs.

- Make it easy for advocates to share content and reviews on social media. Provide shareable images, videos, and posts that spread your message.

- Host exclusive advocate events where your biggest fans can network, provide feedback, and get early access to new products. 

- Feature advocates prominently on your website and in marketing materials. Let their enthusiasm be contagious.

- Send advocates small gifts and personalized notes thanking them for their loyalty and referrals. Make them feel valued.

- Ask advocates for video testimonials that can be used in marketing. Capture their passion!

- Keep an open dialogue with advocates to continuously improve their experience. They are your secret weapon.

- Surprise advocates with over-the-top experiences that show your gratitude. WOW them.

- Facilitate introductions between advocates and new customers. Let them spread the love.

The key is to make your biggest fans feel special, listened to, and involved. Their passion is your best marketing!

 

- The best referrals come from happy, satisfied customers who have fully experienced your product or service. Don't ask for referrals too early in the customer relationship.

- Asking for referrals immediately after a purchase is often unsuccessful because the customer hasn't had time to experience the benefits. They want confirmation that the product/service delivers what was promised. 

- Don't ask new customers to provide personal contacts right away - this presumes a familiarity that doesn't yet exist. Make referral asks feel natural by giving customers the information they need to easily refer others.

- Achieving advocacy status with customers is the ultimate goal. Advocates are loyal, do repeat business, make referrals, and require less marketing/sales costs to retain.

- Focus on getting reviews and testimonials from advocates after they have achieved their goals from using your product/service. This results in higher quality, more persuasive reviews.

- The dog accessories company 4Knines gets a very high review rate on Amazon by waiting to ask until customers have used the product and achieved their goals. Timing is critical.

 

- 4Knines sends customers an email 2 weeks after purchase gently asking for a review. This works very well, generating reviews 24% of the time. 

- The email is carefully crafted to make it easy for the customer to leave a review. It starts by asking a friendly favor, estimates it will only take 3 minutes, reminds the customer of 4Knines' brand story, then provides a link to leave a review. 

- When 4Knines temporarily stopped sending this email, their sales plummeted 73% from over $260,000 to $74,000 per month. This demonstrated the importance of reviews for their Amazon sales. 

- Many 4Knines reviews mention the CEO Jim by name, showing the company creates remarkable customer experiences. Loyal customers are like their dogs.

- When asking for testimonials, give customers guidance on what to include. Offer to draft it for them to make it easy. Focus on benefits and results. Add spice if it fits their voice. The easier you make advocating, the more customers will do it.

 

- Advocacy refers to getting customers to recommend your product or service to others. It can be a powerful growth strategy if done properly. 

- Dropbox offered customers bonus storage space for referring friends. This benefited both the referrer (more free storage) and referee (free storage) leading to exponential growth for Dropbox.

- Companies should reward referrals in a way that encourages the behavior they want. Dropbox's referral program worked so well because storage space was valuable to its tech-savvy early adopters. 

- Delta offered loyalty program members bonus miles, including elite status-qualifying miles, for referring others to their co-branded credit card with American Express. This incentivized top customers by offering something personally meaningful.

- Entrepreneurial group Maverick1000 offered members the chance to win a trip to Richard Branson's private island for bringing in the most new members. Associating the brand with an aspirational figure encouraged referrals.

- The key is to understand what motivates your best customers and offer referral rewards tailored to them rather than generic incentives. This turns happy customers into vocal advocates.

 

- Richard Branson is one of the top 3 most famous and successful entrepreneurs. His private island was used as an incentive to get entrepreneurs to participate in a referral campaign, which became very successful. 

- The key to creating great referral campaigns is to offer something exclusive that customers want but can't easily get themselves. It doesn't have to be expensive, just memorable.

- Word-of-mouth referrals are powerful. MastermindTalks used "golden tickets" to get existing attendees to refer only one new person each year. This made the referral very valuable.

- MastermindTalks rewarded referrers with amazing experiences like tours and safaris, which made everyone want to refer people the next year. 

- You should develop referral programs that get your loyal customers excited to spread the word, as this helps create lifelong advocates.

- The right referral is more important than just any referral. Treat your customers like family and community, and they will bring you qualified prospects.

- Unexpected rewards heighten the referral experience. If you seek referrals in this way, customers will rush to bring prospects.

 

The Advocate Phase is when a customer becomes a raving fan who actively promotes your business through referrals and testimonials. To enhance this phase:

- Provide unique in-person experiences like inviting advocates on sales calls or exclusive events. Make them feel special. 

- Send personalized, friendly emails that feel like notes from a friend rather than a business. Make asks easy to fulfill.

- Mail handwritten cards or gifts as a milestone marker of their top customer status. 

- Have the CEO or executive call to thank them for their loyalty and advocacy.

- Ask for creative, authentic video testimonials to showcase.

- Give free products or services for advocates to gift to friends to spread positive word-of-mouth.

Overall, the goal is to show extra appreciation and create remarkable experiences for your best customers in order to encourage further referrals and advocacy. Rate your current program and look for ways to improve meaningful personalization across every communication channel.

 

- Making personal and emotional connections with customers is powerful. Personal data points relate to an individual's life details, like where they went to college. Emotional data elicits positive feelings, like nostalgia for their college days. 

- When investigating current customers, start with their name. Names are very important to people. 

- Use a customer relationship management (CRM) system to store what you learn. Prioritize ease of use over features.

- Pick 5-10 "must collect" data fields to start tracking now. Add 5-10 more later once the system is established. 

- Review your CRM records and fill in anything you already know about customers.

- Research customers online - LinkedIn, Facebook, company websites. Record profile URLs in the CRM. Study photos for insights. 

- Google search customers' names to find mentions in media. 

- Use surveys to fill knowledge gaps efficiently.

- If needed, directly ask customers for missing info. But minimize this to impress them with your knowledge.

 Here are some key points on observing customers to enhance their experience:

- Watch customers using your product/service in their natural environments. See how they interact and where they struggle. Put yourself in their shoes.

- Pay attention to subtle cues like offhand comments, facial expressions, and body language. These can reveal insights. 

- Document your observations through notes, photos, videos. Review later with your team to spot patterns and opportunities.

- Look for minor details and microinteractions that could be improved. Small things like website load times, confusing menus, or unclear signs can have a big impact.

- Try experiencing your product/service like a new customer would. Note points of confusion or friction.

- Talk to frontline staff about what they notice customers doing. They have valuable insights.

- Keep observing over time. Customer behaviors and needs change. Continual observation allows you to keep improving.

- Focus on understanding the customer's real experience, needs, and emotions. Observe with empathy. 

- Let observations uncover the moments that matter most to customers. Then focus innovation on elevating these moments.

The key is immersing yourself in the customer experience through observation. Keep an open and curious mindset. The insights you gain can unlock major improvements.

 

- Personalize interactions with customers by using information you have learned about them through investigation and observation. Leverage common interests, hobbies, backgrounds etc. to make connections.

- Personal "wows" are a great way to create remarkable customer experiences by incorporating personalized and emotional elements into communications with individual customers. 

- You can also create "wow moments" for groups of customers who share common interests by designing targeted communications around those interests. 

- Customer appreciation events built around common interests shared by a segment of your customer base are another opportunity for personalization.

- Surprising customers is key - go above and beyond with thoughtful, personalized gifts instead of generic items like gift cards. Strategic gifting can strengthen relationships and show you care.

- The goal is to make interactions meaningful by truly getting to know customers as individuals, not treating them as commodities. Personalization in all forms is the key to creating remarkable experiences.

 

- Surprising customers and their families with thoughtful, high-quality gifts without your logo builds lasting relationships. Personalize gifts with the recipient's name when possible.

- Don't just gift the main customer contact. Surprise their spouse, children, assistant, and team too. This expands your positive reputation.

- Give remarkable experiences like dinners or events, but also provide a memento or photo to memorialize it. Experiences fade, mementos last.  

- Avoid gifting around major holidays when it gets lost in the noise. Make it random and unexpected.

- Give the best gifts you can afford as an investment in the relationship, not cheap gifts that send the wrong message. Budget 2-10% of profits for gifting.

- Don't expect anything in return and don't worry if some gifts miss the mark. The positive returns will come.

- Always include a handwritten note with a gift. Don't bother gifting without personalization.

- Get employees involved early when instituting an appreciation program. Let them co-create it to boost commitment.

- Have leaders model desired behaviors first before expecting employees to change. Lead by example.

- Share stories of success and positive outcomes from gifting and appreciation. Make it real.

- Recognize and reward employees who embrace appreciation. Make it part of reviews and compensation.

 

- Comcast is often cited as having one of the worst customer experiences across industries. The author shares his own horrible experience trying to set up new service with Comcast.

- The appointment was scheduled a week out with a 4-hour arrival window (8am-12pm). The technician never showed up during that window. 

- When calling to complain, the customer service representative was completely unapologetic and unhelpful. The new appointment wasn't for another week.

- The author argues that if a company like Comcast, known for terrible customer service, can turn things around and start improving customer experience, any company can. 

- The key is making customer experience a true priority from the top down. Comcast's CEO spearheaded a massive effort to transform the company's culture to be centered on the customer.

- Comcast increased training for frontline employees, gave them more autonomy to resolve issues, and empowered them to deliver better service. 

- The author encourages readers not to give up on improving customer experience at their own companies. With the right strategy and commitment, change is possible anywhere.

 

- The author had a terrible onboarding experience with Comcast as a new customer, including missed appointments, poor communication, and feeling unimportant. 

- Surveys showed nearly half of Comcast customers rated their experience as "very poor", one of the worst ratings across industries. 

- Comcast realized they needed major changes to improve the customer experience, so they appointed a technology leader, Charlie Herrin, to overhaul the customer experience. 

- Charlie found the customer journey was fragmented across departments, causing a terrible experience. 

- Key stats showed customers had way more issues and called more during the first 90 days. 

- Comcast invested over $1 billion over 4 years to improve training, business processes, and products to enhance the early customer experience.

- Training focused on making every employee responsible for the customer experience. 

- They improved business processes to be more proactive and cohesive across departments.

- Product enhancements focused on educating new customers and anticipating their needs better.

 Here are the key points on how Comcast improved their customer experience:

- Streamlined internal tools and information flow to reduce complexity and errors. Went from 12 tools for onboarding/account management down to just 4. 

- Improved appointment scheduling and on-time arrival. Narrowed appointment windows from 4 hours to 2 hours. Provided $20 credit if technician was even 1 minute late. This dramatically increased on-time arrivals to 97%.

- Created onboarding call centers to handle all new customer inquiries in the first 90 days without transferring. Reduced call volume by 27% in the first 9 months.

- Focused on "fix it right the first time" to solve issues on initial contact. Improved first-time resolution by 5% in the first year. 

- Simplified billing with consistent pricing, digital receipts, and personalized "Explain My Bill" videos. Reduced billing calls by 10% or 6 million calls in 2016.

- Built products to be self-healing and enable self-service. 73% of customers using new app never had to call. 92% fixed systems themselves with new tool.

- Adopted customer-focused mindset across the company, with initiatives like RealTime Assist text alerts during service visits. Focused on key journey points rather than overwhelming customers.

The appendix provided an extensive list of categories of information to potentially track about customers, including basic info, professional details, work history, personal interests, background, family, and military service. The author noted that having a strategy for collecting customer data and committing to use it to make emotional connections is critical. The list of information categories aims to spark ideas about useful customer details to research and record.

 Here is a summary of key points about attitude toward being in the service:

- Customer information such as customer number, items purchased, customer persona, reasons for purchase, customer segments, purchase history, and results achieved provides insights into customer activity, needs, and satisfaction. 

- Tracking this data over time for each customer shows trends and patterns in their relationship with the business.

- Understanding the customer's perspective, such as their stated and actual reasons for purchases, allows the business to align offerings with customer needs.

- Looking at overall customer disposition and repurchase behavior helps assess satisfaction and loyalty. 

- Analyzing this customer data enables proactive outreach to meet expectations, solve problems early, and strengthen the customer relationship.

- Collecting comprehensive customer information takes commitment but pays dividends in customer retention and growth.

In summary, diligently tracking customer data provides a window into the customer experience that facilitates continuously improving service delivery and customer relationships over time.

 Here are the key points and sources from Chapter 3:

- The annual churn rate for wireless carriers in the U.S. is about 30-35%, according to research from WDS. (1)

 Here is a summary of the key points from the article:

The article argues that human beings have a fundamental need to belong and feel connected to others. This need for belongingness drives much of human behavior.

- Evidence shows that lack of social attachment leads to adverse psychological and physical effects. People need frequent, positive interactions within the context of long-term caring relationships.

- The need to belong is a powerful, fundamental, and extremely pervasive motivation. Belongingness needs must be satisfied before other higher-order needs can be fulfilled.

- People form social attachments readily under most conditions and resist dissolution of existing bonds. Even randomly assigned groups show group loyalty and cohesion.  

- Lack of belongingness leads to increased aggression, reduced self-regulation, and other negative outcomes. Strong social bonds are critical for well-being.

- The need to belong applies universally across gender, culture, and age. However, specific norms for how to satisfy belongingness needs vary by group.

- Evidence suggests belongingness needs are innate, evolved adaptations. Attachment behaviors likely improved reproductive fitness over human evolutionary history.  

In summary, the article makes a strong empirical case that the need for social belongingness is a fundamental human motivation with deep roots in human evolution. Satisfying this need is critical for psychological and physical health.

 Here is a summary of the key points from the passages:

- Dale Carnegie advised using people's names to make more friends, as our own name is sweet and important. Hearing our name activates unique brain areas. 

- Atticus Finch advised understanding others' perspectives by figuratively walking in their shoes.

In summary, creating remarkable experiences through personalization and lifestyle branding builds advocacy and loyalty, even despite poor performance. Enabling easy referral and outreach is also effective. Simple personal touches like using names also connect with customers. Empathetic understanding of customers' needs and perspectives is key.
