 Here is a 243-word summary of the above section:

As a young reporter, Alex Osborn learned the value of ideas firsthand when an editor gave him a job based on the ideas in his clippings. This experience convinced Osborn that ideas are valuable and sparked his interest in honing his creative thinking. His work later in advertising further emphasized the importance of ideas. While Osborn gained success through hard work and stepping up his creative thinking, he credits his role as a creative coach helping others unlock their creative potential. Despite the value of ideas, many people scoff at creativity and creative thinking. Colleges give little attention to nurturing creativity. Though judgment serves an important role in refining ideas, schools do little to consciously improve students' creative thinking abilities. While the book focuses on unlocking individual creativity, ideas have played an important role in human progress throughout history.

 Here is a summary of the key points regarding the vise, internal combustion engines, and farm machinery:

- The vise is used as an example of tools that demonstrate human creativity and problem-solving ability. Improved tools like the vise have helped drive civilization forward.

- Internal combustion engines are cited as an example of farm machinery that has been significantly improved through creative efforts. New ideas and designs have led to more efficient engines.

- Farm machinery in general has benefited from creativity and new ideas that have made agriculture more productive. New and improved machinery has helped increase crop yields and efficiency.

The overarching message is that human creativity and the ability to come up with new ideas has been instrumental in developing better tools and technologies like the vise, engines, and farm machinery. Creative thinking has helped solve problems and drive progress in these areas.

Does this summary cover the key points regarding the vise, internal combustion engines, and farm machinery as discussed in the passage? Let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on any part of the summary.

 Here is a summary of the key points in the passage:

1) Creativity is more dependent on effort than on educational degrees or academic training. Many great creative thinkers lacked formal higher education.  

2) Creative power often peaks around age 50, and can continue into old age as long as there is effort and drive. Examples of creative thinkers who achieved their greatest work later in life are given.

3) Creativity does not require an "ivory tower"; ideas can come anywhere as long as a person sets aside time for creative thinking. Examples of unconventional places like beds, baths, and walks that can spark creativity are mentioned.

4) Routine tasks are best done in the afternoons, leaving mornings for creative thinking. Setting aside specific time periods for creativity can help induce creative thinking. 

5) Sleeping on ideas can help hatch better ones, so jotting down initial creative thoughts before sleeping can aid the subconscious mind. Insomnia can sometimes be turned into an opportunity for creativity.

In summary, the key is to make an effort to think creatively, set aside specific time for it, and not let the lack of a formal degree or training hinder one's creative power. Creativity can last far into old age and can come anywhere if the right conditions and mindset are present.

 Here is a summary of the key points in the passage:

1. Imagination can be non-creative or creative. Non-creative forms include daydreaming, worry and unhealthy mental states.

2. Creative imagination has two main functions: hunting for new ideas and changing existing ideas. It requires intent and effort, not just passive thought. 

3. Different forms of imagination include visual imagery, vicarious imagination and anticipative imagination. Truly creative imagination combines hunting and changing functions.

4. Too much of an ability to recall facts and figures can block creative thinking, but a well-stocked mind with rich knowledge and experiences provides "fuel" for creativity. Memories serve as material for imagination to build upon, not just reproduce the past.

5. Creativity requires forward thinking and "action of the mind" rather than just passive memory. Writing down ideas helps generate more alternatives and new combinations.

In summary, the passage distinguishes between non-creative and creative forms of imagination, focusing mainly on the hunting and changing functions of creative imagination. It emphasizes that creativity requires active thinking, effort and a rich store of knowledge and experiences to draw from.

 

The author argues that first-hand experiences gain during childhood and youth provide richer material for creative work later in life compared to second-hand experiences. Some examples of first-hand experiences that helped fuel the creativity of famous inventors and artists are given, such as Edison running a newspaper at a young age and O'Neill traveling extensively. However, even second-hand experiences like reading can provide some valuable fuel if done actively. The author also discusses the role of association - the linking of ideas through similarity, contrast, etc. - in creative thinking. Techniques like keeping notebooks and checklists are suggested to enhance association. Finally, the author points out that emotional drive is an important source of creative power, though fear and coercion tend to stifle creativity.

 Here is a summary of the key points in the text:

1. Love of country inspired hundreds of thousands of people to come up with creative ideas that helped win the war. Emotional drive is an important factor in creative pursuits but it is not reliable on its own. Discipline and hard work are also needed.

2. Even geniuses like E.M. Statler said that every great idea comes from hard work and effort. Willpower is essential for creativity; everyone has the potential to achieve a lot through will and imagination. 

3. There are ways to harness willpower for creativity, like setting a time and place to think, setting deadlines, taking notes, setting quotas, and persistence. Keeping at it for a few strokes longer can make the difference.

4. While judgment is important, it can choke creativity if not kept in check. Imagination requires reaching beyond the facts, while judgment focuses on analyzing and evaluating facts. 

5. Judgment grows automatically with age and education but creativity requires conscious effort. People are quick to judge but slow to recognize imagination. The key is to judge wisely at the right time, not too soon.

 Here is a summary of the key points in the passage:

1. Others can either help or hinder an individual's creativity. Praise and encouragement tend to boost creativity while discouragement can stifle it. 

2. A boss can play an important role in coaching and inspiring creative ideas from employees. Listening receptively to ideas, even imperfect ones, is important.

3. Employees should keep suggesting ideas, even if some are rejected at first. With persistence and revisions, rejected ideas may eventually be accepted.

4. Employees should not take rejections of ideas personally. Try again at a different time.

5. The main hindrance to creativity is often "pride in judgment." Bosses and coworkers can be too quick to criticize instead of encouraging creative ideas.

6. Discouragement from loved ones can have the biggest impact, stunting an individual's creativity from an early age. 

7. As a society, we have not always valued creative ideas and imagination enough to foster them in individuals.

In summary, the passage discusses how others can help or hurt an individual's creativity through their encouragement, coaching, receptiveness to ideas, and ability to check their "pride in judgment." An environment of support and openness to new ideas is most conducive to fostering creativity.

 Here is a summary of the key points in the text:

1. Discouragement can hamper creative growth, so parents and teachers should actively encourage and nurture creativity in children. Creative attempts should be praised, even if imperfect.

2. Doing creative exercises like games, puzzles and writing can strengthen creative muscles. The key is to actually create, not just consume ideas passively.

3. When starting a creative task, it is important to get into the right "working mood." This involves being open-minded, interested and aware.

4. An intense interest and "all-out intent" helps motivate the imagination and set the stage for creative thinking. Having a clear goal can strengthen one's intent.

5. Getting oneself into the right frame of mind - open, interested and intent - can help overcome obstacles and generate more new ideas when working on a creative project.

Does this cover the main points discussed in the summary? Let me know if you need me to clarify or expand on anything.

 Here is a summary of the main points:

1. Having a clear aim and target can help focus your creative thinking. Specific questions can help refine your aim.

2. However, don't focus too narrowly. It's important to broaden your search after getting started. 

3. Analyzing the problem by breaking it down into questions can provide clues and feed your imagination. Imagination also plays a role in analysis.

4. Too many facts at the wrong stage can hinder creativity. It's better to come up with many ideas first before doing in-depth fact finding.

5. You should seek out both inherent and possibly relevant facts. Wide exposure and delving into causes are important. 

6. New facts may require acquiring entirely new knowledge, like Alexander Graham Bell did with electricity.

7. Textbooks can be outdated, so be careful relying too heavily on them for facts.

8. Discovering relationships, like similarities, can uncover principles to guide creative thinking, as Billy Rose did with songwriting.

In summary, having a clear but broad aim, analyzing the problem, acquiring relevant facts at the right stage, and finding relationships can help prepare your mind for creativity. Imagination plays a role throughout the process.

 Here's a summary of the key points in the text:

1. There are no rigid techniques for creativity, but there are principles and guides to procedure. The basic principle is variation - generating plenty of alternatives.

2. Questions like "Why?", "Where?", "When?", etc. can guide the imagination in creative thinking. Constantly asking "What else?" also helps.

3. Quantity breeds quality in creative work. Early ideas are often not the best. Generating a large number of alternatives increases the chances of good ideas.

4. Thinking of new uses for things, materials, principles, talents can help add value and inspire better uses. It also helps generate more alternatives.

5. Borrowing and partially copying from others can be a legitimate source of inspiration and ideas, as long as full attribution and acknowledgment is given. Outright plagiarism should be avoided.

In summary, the key takeaways are: generating plenty of alternatives through variation, questioning, thinking of new uses, and adapting existing ideas in ethical ways. This helps give directions to the imagination to aid creativity.

 Here is a summary of the provided text:

- Many sports, games, stories, and jokes are adapted from earlier versions. Creativity often comes from modifying and adapting existing ideas.

- Asking questions like "What if this were somewhat changed?" or "How can this be altered for the better?" can lead to new twists and improvements. Even small modifications can make a big difference, like the tapered roller bearing. 

- Adding components, ingredients, value, or frequency can improve products and processes. Duplicating or exaggerating features can also produce better ideas.

- Subtracting, dividing, minimizing, and eliminating unnecessary parts can create simpler and faster solutions.

- Seeking substitutes and interchangeable components is another source of creative ideas. Even non-traditional substitutions like using glue in a cleaner can produce breakthroughs.

The key takeaways are that creativity comes from  modifying, adapting, altering and substituting existing ideas. Asking questions about changes, additions, subtractions and substitutions can generate numerous alternative ideas to improve products, processes and solutions.

 Here is a summary of the key points in the text:

1. Imagination and creative thinking involve piling up alternatives in various ways like re-arrangement, combination, vice versa thinking, and opposites. This increases the chances of finding good ideas.

2. After generating alternatives, it is important to let the mind go blank to allow "butterflies" or stray ideas to come in through illumination. 

3. Illumination is an effortless process of finding bright ideas suddenly. However, some willpower may be needed to set the right mood for it.

4. Many scientists and authors have reported experiencing 'Aha!' moments of sudden insight after periods of deliberate thinking and brooding.

5. The text discusses illumination but does not provide a definitive explanation for it. It mentions the "subconscious at work" but dismisses that as too general.

Does this cover the main points accurately? Let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand anything.

 Here is a summary of the key points regarding illumination:

• Inner tension or motivation appears to explain illumination to some degree. But there are likely other factors at play.

• Illumination thrives on enthusiasm, which tends to fade with excessive mental strain. Taking breaks can regenerate our motivation.

• Allowing our minds to wander freely, as during incubation periods, helps our subconscious minds find novel connections and ideas.

• Sleep and naps allow our subconscious minds to work on problems, often resulting in illumination upon waking.

• Relaxing activities like hobbies, exercise, and music can induce illumination. Spiritual activities like prayer and church can also help. 

• Most experts recommend recording illumination when it occurs, however fleetingly, to preserve the insights. Several anecdotes highlight the dangers of not capturing illumination immediately.

• In summary, incubation and illumination involve a complex interplay of conscious and unconscious mental processes. Taking breaks, relaxing, and allowing the subconscious free reign can effectively stimulate creative insights. But these insights must then be adequately captured to fully benefit from illumination.

 Here is a summary of the key points in the text:

1. Illumination comes unplanned, while inspiration often comes from an "accidental stimulus" that can be traced. Illumination comes from past knowledge, while inspiration can come from both past and present. 

2. Accidents alone rarely lead to new ideas; persistent effort and follow through are needed. Luck favors those actively seeking answers.

3. Most new ideas build incrementally on previous ideas in a step-by-step process over long periods of time. Ice cream history shows this.

4. Ideas ahead of their time may not be fully developed. Having the seeds of an idea is not enough; it must be nurtured to grow.

5. Even small ideas should not be rejected, as they could be adapted for other uses.

In summary, the text argues that new ideas come from a complex mix of illumination, inspiration, persistence, preparedness, and incremental steps built on previous knowledge. Accidents and luck can play a role but require follow through and effort to realize their full potential.

 Here is a summary of the provided text:

The biggest lesson we can learn from the step-by-step nature of ideas is that we can never stop improving. Businesses that fail to innovate and update eventually go out of business, as illustrated by the examples of Barney and Smith railroad car company and Pierce Arrow car manufacturer. 

When stuck in the creative process, it is important to backtrack, reanalyze the problem, come up with more alternatives, and start over again. If an attempted creative project fails, redoing the entire process from start to finish can sometimes yield success. However, perfectionism should be avoided. A good idea implemented is better than a great idea that is endlessly refined.

Creative work can be done individually, in teams, or in groups. Lone thinkers and those whose work requires solitary thought accomplish much creativity on their own. However, properly organized teams and groups can also generate many good ideas. Teamwork comes with both benefits and hazards. Teams must periodically break apart and brainstorm alone to maximize creative output. Team members should also switch roles occasionally to remain open to new ideas.

Brainstorming groups of 5 to 10 people that include a mix of experienced and novice members can be "gold mines of ideas." Judgment and criticism must be left out during the brainstorming process. Groups work best when focusing on specific, narrow problems rather than broad, complex ones. The brainstorm leader must emphasize unleashing wild ideas without judgment at the start.

 Here is a summary of the text:

1. Brainstorming helps generate ideas through collective thinking and fostering an environment that discourages criticism. Guidelines emphasize quantity and combination of ideas.

2. Suggestion systems can promote creativity on a larger scale within organizations. However, many early suggestion systems failed due to lack of support from management. 

3. Education could do more to nurture creative thinking in students. This includes focusing more on principles and ideas rather than facts, providing creative projects outside the curriculum, and encouraging creative expression.

4. Creative thinking and imagination are important for effective leadership. Leaders need to recognize the value of creativity, tap the creative potential of their teams, and set an example as creative thinkers themselves.

5. Large businesses sometimes stifle creativity due to a lack of urgency and overreliance on analysis. Good leaders cultivate creativity in their employees and value new ideas.

The key takeaways are that brainstorming, suggestion systems, education, and creative leadership are all ways to foster and apply creative thinking and imagination within individuals and organizations. The text advocates for giving more attention and support to nurturing creative power.

 Here is a summary of the provided text:

The founders of companies sometimes tend to stunt creativity from younger associates as they grow older. Clare Francis of General Foods is an exception, as he encourages new ideas from younger executives. Francis mentioned that half of the youthful ideas he initially dismissed ended up being successful or led to other successful ideas. This shows that while the ideas themselves were not new, the conditions under which they were implemented were different.

Bringing up the creative powers of second-line executives is one of the needs of big businesses. While conferences are common, they often hinder rather than help creativity. Younger executives in conferences tend to anticipate others' reactions instead of using their imaginations freely. 

Though many businesses now have suggestion systems to gather creative contributions, less is done to stimulate ideas from associate executives. More could be achieved through group brainstorming. Creativity is important for quality of leadership, not just in business but in every field.
