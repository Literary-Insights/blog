 Here is a summary of the contents of the book "Advertising Secrets of the Written Word" by Joseph Sugarman:

The book is divided into four main sections. Section one covers understanding the copywriting process. It includes chapters on general and specific knowledge needed, practice, the purpose of graphic elements, creating the perfect buying environment, resonating with readers, using curiosity triggers, incubation, determining copy length, personal communication, sequencing copy, and the editing process. 

Section two explains powerful copy elements and psychological triggers that work. It details service discussions, endorsements, involvement, honesty, integrity, credibility, value, urgency, authority, satisfaction, product nature, prospect nature, fads, timing, linking, consistency, storytelling and more. 

Section three provides advertising examples like "The Lazy Man's Way to Riches", "A Fluke of Nature", "Lingerie for Men" and others to prove the points discussed. 

Section four covers utilizing skills for different media like catalogs, direct mail, newspapers, billboards, radio, television and more. It ends with some final thoughts and four appendixes on constraints, curiosity, axioms, and recommended reading.

The book aims to teach readers the secrets, techniques and processes needed to write highly effective copy that sells. It provides both theoretical explanations and practical advertising examples. The goal is for readers to understand and apply the concepts discussed to improve their own copywriting abilities.

 Here is a summary of the key points made in the introductions and acknowledgments:

- Joe Sugarman is seen as a role model for direct marketing copywriters due to his prolific and unconventional writing style over many years through his JS&A catalogs. His personal approach to catalogs has also inspired many imitators. 

- While he may not have directly learned from mail order legends of the past like David Margoles, Max Sackheim and John Caples, Sugarman intuitively understands what made them successful - things like emphasizing social benefits over product features.

- This book aims to pass on Sugarman's talents and lessons about writing in a straightforward, accessible way. It focuses on both selling skills and basic writing truths. 

- Sugarman no longer writes as much copy as he used to, now focusing more on infomercials and home shopping. The book stands as his record of advice and legacy for direct marketing writers.

- In his acknowledgments, Sugarman thanks various people who have contributed to his skills and business success over many years, including his company president Mary Stanke, ex-wife Wendy and children, and copy editor sister Judy Sugarman. He also thanks his many customers for providing an education.

 

- The author introduced copywriting seminars he developed in the 1970s that taught direct marketing techniques. These were highly successful and attended by industry leaders. 

- The seminars were held at a beautiful remote property in northern Wisconsin, which provided an ideal setting for learning. They were the most expensive seminars in the industry at the time.

- Through many failures in his own direct marketing business, the author gained valuable lessons that he shared at the seminars. His successes attracted much attention as well. 

- The goal of the seminars and this book is to teach how to write compelling copy that motivates people to purchase a product or service. Key elements include flow, psychology, emotions, and overcoming common pitfalls. 

- In addition to copywriting skills, the seminars provided a motivational experience for many attendees who then found success in business. The principles applied to other marketing beyond just print ads.

- The book aims to convey the thought processes and unique approach to copywriting that was so impactful for the seminar participants in driving real business results.

 

The passage discusses the importance of broad general knowledge and experience for developing strong copywriting skills. It emphasizes that the best copywriters have diverse interests and continually seek out new learning experiences and skills. Their wide range of knowledge and experiences gives them a large "bank" to draw ideas from when developing marketing concepts and copy. 

Specific points made include:

- Having curiosity, reading widely, traveling, exploring hobbies, and mastering multiple skills leads to more effective copywriting.

- Experiences, both successes and failures, provide lessons that can generate future marketing ideas. 

- The brain functions like a computer - more experiences and knowledge allow for more complex connections between ideas.

- Lateral thinking, like Edward de Bono's "Think Tank" technique, helps cue new perspectives on problems by relating them to unrelated concepts.

The key idea is that broad life experiences and always seeking new learning greatly enhances one's abilities as a copywriter.

 

- To be an effective copywriter, it's important to become an expert on the product or service being written about. This means learning enough specific knowledge to be able to communicate the benefits effectively. 

- It may take spending time learning details through research, conversations with product experts, and understanding the technology/mechanisms involved. The goal is to reach a point where you feel you can expertly communicate the product.

- It's also important to understand the target customer - their interests, motivations, likes/dislikes. The copywriter should be able to view things from the customer's perspective. 

- Even if the product and customer are understood, the copywriter must discover the inherent "nature" of how the product should be positioned and presented in the customer's mind. 

- Real-world experiences can help reinforce concepts. The story about the author's neighbor dying helped him finally understand the value and purpose of insurance in a new light.

So in summary, to be an effective copywriter requires gaining specific knowledge of the product, customer, and properly presenting the product in a way that resonates based on its inherent nature or positioning.

 

The author realized the importance of understanding the nature of the product being sold after a personal experience of having his home burglarized. This event close to home made him take action to better understand burglar alarms and how to effectively market them. He realized scare tactics and crime statistics would not work, and instead focused the marketing message on addressing consumer needs and emphasizing the reliability and ease of use of the product. This event showed him that sometimes it takes a threat close enough to home to motivate someone to take action, whether that's purchasing a product or changing one's marketing approach. Understanding this informed how he successfully marketed and grew his burglar alarm business.

 

- Copywriting is about effectively communicating ideas to sell a product or service through the written word. It requires broad knowledge and specific knowledge about the product or service. 

- All elements of an advertisement like headlines, photos, copy etc. have the primary purpose of getting the reader to read the first sentence of the copy. Their individual purposes like describing a photo are secondary. 

- The first sentence needs to be very short and compelling to grab the reader's attention and get them to read the second sentence. It should be almost incomplete so the reader keeps reading. 

- Magazines use larger font at the start of articles to draw readers in, then reduce font size once they are engaged. Advertisements only have a short time to engage readers.

- The purpose of each subsequent sentence is to get the reader to read the next sentence. The copywriting goal is to keep readers engaged and reading through compelling short sentences until they are motivated to take the desired action.

 

- The purpose of the first few sentences in an advertisement is to get the reader to read the following sentences. This holds the reader's attention. 

- Advertising works similarly to an in-person sales presentation - if the opening doesn't engage the customer, they will lose interest and walk away. 

- In addition to grabbing attention, the early part of an ad aims to create a "buying environment" that puts the reader in the right mindset to make a purchase. 

- The environment can be controlled more in advertising compared to an in-person sales presentation. Through copy and graphic design, an ad can establish an upscale or discount-oriented atmosphere as needed. 

- The ad layout and first paragraphs should work to draw the reader in and immerse them in an environment conducive to buying the product. This is achieved through compelling copy that resonates with readers.

- Creating the right environment comes from understanding the product/customer and conveying integrity to build trust with the reader. This helps get them in a buying mood like the art gallery experience described.

 

- The passage describes the author's experiences learning about sales techniques by observing small auction shops in Times Square and reading many books on selling. 

- The auction shops would create buying frenzies by appealing to people's greed and selling items that weren't really bargains. 

- The author studied selling to become an expert and effectively sell complicated printing equipment for his father's company. 

- Tests showed the author was suited to careers involving persuasion and literary skills, like advertising. 

- Key lessons from New York included the steps in a sales presentation, like setting the environment, getting attention, introducing oneself, and the sales pitch. 

- An important technique is getting the customer to say "yes" and agree with you to build "harmony." Statements should be truthful so the customer concurs instead of disagreeing. 

- Creating harmony means keeping the customer engaged by making them feel comfortable exchange money for the product or service. 

- An example ad rewrite shows how to start getting the reader to nod their head in agreement from the beginning to keep them reading. 

- The goal is reproducing a selling job through written copy that harmonizes with consumers on a large scale through advertising.

 

- The passages discuss the importance of creating a "slippery slide" effect in copywriting where each element compels the reader to keep reading more. The headline introduces the topic and the subheadline/first sentence encourage reading further. 

- The goal is to have the reader feel like they are nodding in agreement and unable to stop reading the entire piece. Various examples are given like ads for a thermostat and stolen goods reseller. 

- Starting with an interesting story or news item can also help draw the reader in. The early parts set the tone and environment to keep the reader engaged.

- Once a reader engages with over 25% of the content, there is a high chance they will read it all. The copy flows like sliding down a slippery slide unable to stop. 

- Proper use of this technique can result in readers fully examining the offer rather than just scanning past. It allows selling the product in an engaging, compelling way.

 

A company accountant named Johnson was embezzling money from his employer by issuing bogus checks to a fake company called "Cashin Electric Company." He would write checks to "Cash" and then alter them after the fact to say "Cashin Electric Company." 

Eventually his boss noticed the large payments being made and discovered the company didn't exist. Johnson was caught and sent to prison. 

His wife was more sympathetic than the judge. She wanted to help her husband and suggested he get an exercise product for his cell. The prison agreed to let him have a Precor precision rowing machine. 

The story then went on to discuss assumed constraints and how even large animals like elephants still perceive constraints from their early experiences, even if the actual constraints are no longer there. An example puzzle was given to illustrate how people often assume constraints that don't actually exist when trying to solve problems.

 

The passage discusses the concept of "seeds of curiosity" in marketing copywriting. Seeds of curiosity are short teasing statements placed at the end of paragraphs to encourage readers to keep reading. Examples include "but there's more" and "now here comes the good part." 

The author explains how seeds of curiosity work subconsciously to increase readership even when the copy slows down. They are compared to hooks used in television shows before commercial breaks. 

The passage then provides an example of how the author once received an unusual phone call from an attractive woman named Ginger. Ginger claimed to have developed an emotional attachment to the author based solely on reading his marketing advertisements over several years. 

Ginger invited the author to meet with her privately for help with a failed direct mail campaign. When they met, Ginger explained that she runs a beauty shop in a shopping center. She knows traffic in the center directly impacts her sales. She invested all her money in a 50,000-piece direct mail campaign for her cosmetics but got very low response, unable to break even. She asks the author to review her mailing piece to determine what went wrong and help get it to work. 

The passage leaves the interaction ambiguous, questioning Ginger's true intentions and whether she was merely attempting to proposition or guilt the author into helping with her mailing campaign. It raises the concept of using perceived guilt, sex or other means to get something from someone.

 Here is a summary of the key points about emotion in advertising:

- Every word has an associated emotion and tells a story. Advertising should evoke emotions. 

- Good ads are emotional outpourings of words, feelings and impressions, not just logical arguments. 

- We buy based on emotion, but justify purchases with logic. Advertising should appeal to emotions but present logical justifications.

- Mercedes advertising focuses on technical features as logical justifications, but people really buy based on the prestige and emotions associated with the brand. 

- Songs are emotional because the music evokes feelings - words alone can sound silly. Advertising works similarly by setting an emotional tone.

- Even illogical phrases can be effective if they convey the right emotional message or feeling. Emotion is more important than strict logic in persuading people.

The key takeaway is that advertising should focus on evoking emotions, not just making logical arguments. People buy based on how products make them feel, so advertising needs to connect with people at an emotional level through the language, images and tone used.

 

- The passage advocates for selling the concept or "sizzle", not just the product or "steak". Focusing on unique attributes and positioning appeal more to consumers than just explaining features logically. 

- Early examples highlighted how competitor ads for a new digital calculator display failed by focusing too much on technical details, while the author's ad framed it as a "Pocket Yellow Pages" to tap into emotional appeal. 

- Concepts can come inherently from breakthrough new products, but as they become common, each needs a unique concept to differentiate. Examples included different watch concepts based on attributes. 

- A concept effectively frames or packages the product in an engaging way, like calling a pocket CB a "Pocket CB" or an electronic phone book a "Pocket Yellow Pages". 

- Products can also be combined under a single umbrella concept to draw attention, like promoting an alarm and chess computer as "Winners". The key is selling the intangible concept or appeal over just the basic product.

 Here is a summary of key points from the passage:

- The author receives a call from his supplier in Hong Kong about getting Soviet chess champion Anatoli Karpov to endorse their chess computer, which could help sales. 

- The author comes up with the concept of challenging Karpov to a game with their computer instead of just endorsing it. This adds drama and emotional appeal to promote the product.

- The first ad with this concept is headlined "Soviet Challenge" and discusses how Karpov represents Communist prowess at chess. It positions facing the computer as confronting American technology.

- Karpov initially threatens to sue over using his name without permission. But the supplier works it out and Karpov agrees to endorse the computer instead of playing the challenge. 

- Three ads in total are run with different concepts, selling over 20,000 computers. The concepts are more effective at selling than just describing the product. 

- Changing a product's price can significantly alter its perceived concept and target audience, even with similar advertising copy.

- Developing the right concept and positioning is key to differentiating a product and driving success over competitors.

 

The passage discusses the incubation process, which refers to unconsciously working on a problem or project while doing something else. This allows the subconscious mind to work in the background. 

Some key points:

- Incubation works best under some pressure or urgency. Factors that can add pressure include time limits, ego/reputation, job expectations, creativity level, and work environment. 

- Taking breaks from a project and coming back to it later, or working on multiple projects at once, facilitates the incubation process. 

- The subconscious mind uses existing knowledge and experiences to solve problems during incubation. With the right balance of pressures, this can produce optimal results.

- Managers should give creative employees some freedom and separate workspace to allow for incubation activities like thinking, relaxing, or discussing ideas with others. Strict rules and oversight can hinder creativity.

 

The passage describes how the author created a very long (4,000 word) job posting for an assistant for his fundraising company. Despite the long length, it pulled in more qualified respondents than he could interview. 

This shows that there is no set limit on how long copy should be, as long as it produces results. Sales pitches and materials can vary widely in length depending on the product, price point, and complexity. 

Higher priced or more unusual products generally require more copy to justify the price and explain the unique features. Longer copy allows the seller to educate customers and increase perceived value. It also gives time to fully tell the product story. 

However, short copy can also work if the environment and value are conveyed through other means like photos and low prices. The key is having copy that motivates the desired action, whether long or short. 

Overall, advertising copy should feel like a personal communication from the seller to the potential customer, using language like "I", "you", and "me". Personal, emotional language makes the message warmer and builds a better connection than impersonal language.

 The key points are:

- Effective print ads can still speak directly to the reader as if a single individual, using words like "I", "you", etc. 

- One way to do this is by using a byline, attributing the copy to a specific person from the organization. This helps make the tone personal. 

- Good copy flows logically from one point to the next, anticipating and answering questions the reader may have. 

- Following a logical sequence or "flowchart" in writing helps ensure the copy progresses smoothly from the headline down. 

- Even children can write effective copy if they understand the principles of writing in a personal, question-answering style and following a logical flow.

 Here is a summary of the key points about the flowchart copy sequence and editing process for direct marketing copy:

- The flowchart for copy sequence should go in one direction - down. This ensures the copy flows logically from one point to the next, anticipating and answering the reader's questions. 

- The copy addresses interest and excitement in the first paragraph, then weaves drama and differences from there. Subsequent paragraphs explain features, construction details, benefits of purchase, and address common objections like lasting value and service. 

- The copy flows like a conversation, raising the next logical question at each point. 

- Editing is key to turning raw ideas into polished, resonant copy. It's like turning coal into diamond - refining to express the idea concisely with the fewest words while maintaining emotional impact. 

- The goal of editing is to have the copy express exactly what is intended in the clearest, most efficient way, just like nurturing a child to be well-rounded and effective. Editing is refining the message.

- Block diagrams and copying styles of admired writers can help develop the flow and ideas, but one must be careful not to copy layouts too closely.

 Here are the key points about editing advertising copy:

- The goal of editing is to express your thoughts in the fewest words possible while maintaining the same meaning and emotional impact. 

- You can edit by rearranging words/phrases, cutting unnecessary words, substituting clearer words, or adding words for clarification - but with the goal of conciseness. 

- Look for "that" words, edit for rhythm/sentence length, combine sentences, and eliminate filler words like "the".

- Rearranging thoughts can improve logical flow and emotional impact. 

- Editing takes time - some copy needs intensive editing while other times it flows almost perfectly. Experience improves the editing process. 

- Computers make editing much easier through features like find/replace, spell check, and seamlessly rearranging text. 

- Taking a break from your copy and coming back to it later can help with the editing process. The overall aim is to clearly communicate your message using as few words as possible.

 

- The chapter discusses important copy elements that should be considered when writing an advertisement, including typeface, first sentence, second sentence, paragraph headings, and others. 

- The first sentence is critical for grabbing the reader's attention and compelling them to continue reading. The second sentence must also build interest to keep the momentum going.

- Paragraph headings are used to make the copy look less intimidating by breaking it up into chunks. They don't necessarily have to be related to the content underneath. 

- Serif typefaces like those used in books produce greater comprehension than sans serif types. Legibility of all typefaces used is important.

- Testing unconventional paragraph headings showed they don't need to be directly related to the content to still be effective in encouraging reading. The main goal is making the copy inviting to look at.

The key takeaway is to focus on copy elements that grab attention, build momentum, and make the content easy and compelling for the reader to engage with from the first sentence onwards.

 

- Paragraph headings are primarily used to make dense copy more approachable and less intimidating for readers. They break up long paragraphs into more digestible chunks. 

- A secondary purpose may be to arouse curiosity and encourage readers to learn more by reading the paragraph. However, the main goal is approachability. 

- When explaining a product, simplify complicated products and complicate simple products. For example, describe the intricate workings of a simple smoke detector to make it seem more valuable. 

- Be sure to fully explain all the features and benefits of the product so readers understand it. Ask others to review your copy and identify any gaps.

- Highlight unique or novel features that distinguish your product from competitors. 

- Provide technical explanations to build expertise and credibility as a seller. Using technical terminology shows knowledge, even if readers don't understand all the terms. 

- Anticipate consumer objections and address them proactively in the copy. Resolving doubts builds trust.  

- Consider your target audience's gender and communicate in a way that does not offend or exclude parts of the market. Tailor the message appropriately.

 

- The author received a critical letter from a woman in response to an ad he ran for gold space chains. The ad featured the author's friend "Bob Ross" and a picture of Bob's cousin modeling the chains. 

- The woman accused the ad of portraying women in a disrespectful way and not reflecting their achievements and roles in the 20th century. She wished the author immediate bankruptcy.

- The author reflects that he may have been insensitive to women in his ad copy and demeaning of them. He reproduces the ad for the reader to judge.

- The author acknowledges the importance of understanding differences but also similarities between men and women, and how to communicate respectfully with both audiences. 

- One of his key lessons from advertising is the importance of addressing customer concerns about product service upfront to alleviate objections and turn a potential negative into a positive selling point. 

- He provides examples from past ads where directly addressing service concerns, like providing unconditional warranties and loaner products, helped overcome objections and boost sales. Strong service commitments can melt consumer resistance.

 Here are the key points from the passage:

- Joe was an effective salesman not just because he was personable, but because he handled customer service issues himself and became customers' personal representative. His focus on service, rather than just price, drove repeat business and word-of-mouth referrals. 

- When selling products by mail order or without being able to inspect them in person, it is important to provide all relevant physical specifications like weight, dimensions, limits, speed, etc. Even details the writer thought unimportant actually mattered to customers. Leaving anything out gave customers an "excuse not to buy."

- Trial periods of at least one month, and preferably two months, increase confidence and reduce returns. Shorter trial periods add pressure and increase the chance customers return an item rather than commit to keeping it. A generous trial period signals the company's confidence in the product.

- Price comparisons to similar products establish value and justify a product's worth. They must be completely accurate to avoid legal issues. Celebrity endorsements can boost credibility if they make sense for the product.

- Summarizing the offer near the end reminds readers what they will receive if they purchase. Leaving out important details is a common mistake.

 

The chapter discusses 31 psychological triggers that should be considered when writing direct response advertising copy. These triggers took the author years to understand through failure, experience and insight. 

The first trigger discussed is creating a feeling of involvement or ownership for the product. Advertisers should try to make readers imagine using or experiencing the product through vivid descriptions. This generates mental pictures and involvement. TV and internet are effective because they allow seeing and touching the product. 

An example is given of an ad the author wrote for a spelling computer. It included misspelled words and offered $2 off the product price for each word circled. This generated involvement by having readers interact with the ad.  

In general, psychological triggers are subtle but effective motivational messages that good direct response copy should convey. Considering these concepts can dramatically improve ad performance. The checklist of triggers provides insight into crafting an engaging sales message.

 

The author wrote an advertisement with intentional misspellings to see if readers would catch them. Surprisingly, on average readers only caught half of the misspellings. This earned the author more money than expected from the ad. 

The feeling of involvement, where you make readers feel like they already own the product, can be an effective advertising technique. You take them through imagined steps of owning and using the product.

Honesty is the most important principle for advertising. Being truthful builds trust with consumers, who are smarter than advertisers think. Dishonesty may work temporarily but not in the long run. Consumers can sense insincerity. 

Integrity is conveyed through the truthfulness, design, tone and message of an ad. A clean, neat ad reflects good integrity while one with messy design does not. 

Credibility means being believable. It involves anticipating objections and resolving them transparently. Placing an ad in a credible publication like the Wall Street Journal enhances credibility. 

Ads should convey value and prove the value through comparisons or examples. Educating readers on a product's intrinsic worth is like lowering its price. The buying decision is emotional but logic is used to justify it.

 

- Consumers want to logically justify a purchase, considering its technology, safety, and resale value, rather than make an emotional purchase they may regret. The ad should help resolve doubts about value. 

- With intense competition, consumers worry about getting the best price. The ad needs to resolve any concerns about whether it's the lowest price available. 

- To answer the question "Can I really justify this purchase?", the ad should provide justification like savings, benefits, meeting needs/wants. This makes the consumer feel like they made the right decision to buy. 

- Greed for a good deal is a strong motivator. Low prices attract buyers even if they don't need something. Very low prices require justifying credibility. Price drops below normal value generate more sales. 

- Establish authority by emphasizing size, expertise, experience to build trust and credibility with consumers. Even small companies can emphasize strengths to seem authoritative. Consumers respect knowledgeable authority when making purchase decisions.

- Consumers want reassurance they made the right choice to avoid mistake. Ads should provide post-purchase satisfaction that it was a good, wise decision through follow-up support.

 

- The passage discusses the importance of understanding both the nature of the product being sold as well as the nature of the prospective customer. 

- It gives examples of how to determine the nature of different types of products - for example, a toy is fun, a blood pressure monitor is serious medical equipment, a burglar alarm provides security. 

- It then shares a personal anecdote about the author's experience joining a fraternity in college to illustrate understanding the nature of the prospective customer. 

- The author realized guys join fraternities mainly to meet girls and for brotherhood/camaraderie. So he created a "Operation Survival" plan to exploit these motivations to dramatically boost membership in the failing fraternity he joined.

- The plan involved inviting beautiful girls to recruiting events and having brothers sincerely praise each other to prospects to create the illusion of camaraderie. This was meant to seduce more guys to join over other fraternities.

- The lesson is understanding both the product and customer nature allows one to effectively market and sell to the desired audience by playing to their motivations and psychological triggers.

 

- Timing is crucial for successfully capitalizing on fads and trends. You want to get involved early in a fad before it peaks. 

- It's difficult to know exactly when the timing is right for a new product introduction. Testing with consumers is important to understand if the market is ready or not. 

- External events can impact timing through no fault of your own. For example, President Carter urging Americans to reduce debt hurt direct response rates at that time. 

- Being too early with a product introduction can lead to failure if the market isn't ready. Being too late means missing the opportunity as similar products take hold. 

- It's important to recognize when the timing is bad, such as a competing product like the Walkman killing interest in the author's Bone Fone product. 

- Media testing can provide insights on timing, but errors are possible so it's not a guarantee. The author learned this when a large advertising campaign had to be pulled due to a mistaken positive media test result.

So in summary, the article emphasizes how crucial and difficult aspects of timing are for successfully bringing products to market when consumer interest and readiness is highest.

 

The author advocates using consistency to increase sales and turn prospects into repeat customers. Once a customer has made an initial small commitment or purchase, they will tend to act consistently with that commitment by making additional purchases. 

The key is to make the first sale or commitment very simple. Then while processing that initial order, upsell additional related products. Customers will often nod their head and agree since they've already committed to purchasing. Examples given include car dealers adding undercoating or floor mats, and catalog customers ordering more since they're already placing an order. 

Consistency plays on people's natural tendency to behave in line with prior commitments or actions. Getting that first simple commitment established sets the stage to encourage further sales through consistency.

 

- The story discusses how Bobby Darin struggled to break into the music industry singing old standards but was rejected by record labels who didn't think it would sell. 

- Frustrated, Darin wrote and recorded a song called "Splish Splash" that fit with the popular Motown sound at the time in order to get a record deal and recognition. It became a smash hit.

- Despite the success, labels still didn't want to record Darin's preferred style of music. So he used the earnings to self-produce an album including his version of "Mack the Knife" which was also hugely successful. 

- The lesson is that one may need to initially create something that harmonizes or fits with the existing market in order to gain success and recognition, and then pursue one's own goals and ideas once established. Darin followed the market to first raise funds and reputation before doing his preferred style of music.

- The story advocates observing what the market wants and creating something that harmonizes with consumer needs and tastes, even if not one's initial vision, in order to succeed.

 

- Direct marketers try to capitalize on people's urge to collect by selling similar products to existing customers who may want to expand their collection. Many people enjoy collecting series of similar products like watches, dolls, models, sunglasses, etc. 

- When the marketer sold watches, he had success re-marketing other watch products to existing watch customers, tapping into their interest in collecting multiple watches. 

- QVC is also very successful in selling collectible products like dolls, models and sunglasses to viewers who enjoy expanding their collections of those items. 

- Creating a sense of urgency can help convince hesitant customers to purchase rather than delay a decision. Techniques include limited supplies/editions, impending price increases, shipment deadlines, and bundling additional value for immediate orders. 

- Curiosity is also a strong psychological factor that direct marketers can leverage, such as hiding details about a product to generate interest in buyers wanting to experience it for themselves.

 

The message promotes an exclusive opportunity for customers to buy the product before its national launch/introduction at a special price if they order by a certain date. It creates a sense of urgency by implying the product will have higher prices later or may not be available after the introductory period. Fear of missing out on the special opportunity is used as a psychological trigger to motivate potential customers to act. Simplicity, exclusivity/rarity, and instant gratification are also discussed as effective psychological motivators for advertising. The key takeaway is that the ad creates exclusivity, urgency and simplicity to appeal to customer psychology and drive sales.

 

- Simplicity is important in direct response advertising. Complicated layouts, fancy typefaces, and too many options can hurt comprehension and sales. 

- The story gives an example where testing two ads - one offering 9 watch styles and one just offering 1 style. The simple 1-style ad outperformed the complicated 9-style ad 3 to 1. 

- Another example is for a wrinkle cream pill that was supposed to have a complicated dosing schedule. A simple offer of "costs $25 a box, lasts a month" outperformed the complicated dosage explanation. 

- Simplicity is critical for direct response success. It's important not to confuse or overwhelm the customer with too many choices or complex instructions. Keep offers, benefits, and next steps clear and straightforward.

 

- Stories are a powerful tool for creating bonds between the advertiser and prospects. People have been primed for stories since childhood when parents read stories to us. 

- Good stories in advertising hold people's interest, teach lessons or share experiences. Stories add a human element that allows relating closely to prospects. 

- The example ad uses a story format to create curiosity about a new type of sunglasses and their benefits. The story gets people to read the entire ad and sales pitch. 

- Advertising works best when it engages the whole brain, including thought, intuition, sensation and emotion. Simply grabbing attention is temporary. 

- Leaving some things unsaid and letting the reader use their intuition and thought to reach conclusions on their own is more engaging than making things too obvious. It avoids talking down to readers. 

- Experiences where we have to work hard to achieve something are more appreciated than things that come easily. Getting readers to work a little in their own minds increases engagement and impact.

 

- Working hard to solve a difficult problem or reach a conclusion results in a sense of personal satisfaction and achievement. This stimulates and engages the brain in an enjoyable way. 

- Vague or general descriptions require the mind to do more work to fill in the details, which creates a more positive and stimulating mental effect than information that is obvious or obvious conclusions. 

- Specific details and facts are more credible than vague generalities and build trust, making claims more believable. Specifics portray the speaker as an expert who has thoroughly researched the topic.

- Familiar brands, environments, slogans and advertising formats create a sense of recognition and familiarity for the viewer/reader. This familiarity produces a positive attraction, as people feel more comfortable with what is familiar compared to unfamiliar options. It encourages confidence and trust in the familiar thing or brand. 

- Advertising should continue until consumers indicate through lack of sales or response that the campaign has run its course, rather than an advertiser arbitrarily deciding to change a successful campaign just because they have grown tired of it. Focus groups do not always represent how the general public truly feels about long-running advertising.

 Here is a summary of the key points using more familiar words:

The best way to see if an ad works is by looking at sales. Focus groups only tell you what people think you want to hear, not how they will really act. If the product isn't selling, look at the ad campaign. Maybe the ads don't work, or maybe there is strong competition or other issues. 

When making an ad, use words that most people know well. Common numbers like seven are familiar. Popular colors like red seem familiar. Well-known things like chairs are easy for people to picture. These familiar words connect with readers in a subtle way. Testing can help find the most effective familiar words for your product too.

Hope can motivate buying. People hope face cream reduces wrinkles. Golfers hope new balls lower scores. Products imply future benefits rather than guarantees. This "dream" replaces a guaranteed benefit from other purchases. Stories show how hope works for specific products. Scientists must avoid definite claims and let people hope instead of being let down if it doesn't work that way. Repeated vitamin buyers hope they help and see others helped on TV. 

 For products sold through hope, imply what they may do without promises. Health items like vitamins use hope well. Ads should establish credibility so people feel results are possible for them too. Stories from those helped give hope to others.

 Here is a summary of key points from the passage:

- It is easier to sell a "cure" than a "prevention". People are more willing to pay for something that treats an issue they already have than something that prevents a future potential issue. 

- Products can be positioned and marketed as cures rather than preventions to make them easier to sell. Emphasizing the curative aspects rather than preventive aspects is important. 

- As threats, diseases, or problems increase in prevalence, previously preventive products may become viewed more as cures. This can help sellability. 

- You can charge more for a cure than a prevention since the need is more immediate and concrete when seeking a cure for an existing problem. 

- Some products have both preventive and curative aspects. When marketing these, emphasize the curative elements and underplay the preventive elements. 

- Selling truly breakthrough products is difficult because people are skeptical about claims of something really working. Belief is a strong motivator.

- Axiom 15 summarizes the lesson: Selling a cure is easier than a prevention, unless the prevention can be perceived as a cure by emphasizing its curative properties. Understanding this cure/prevention dynamic is important for evaluating and positioning products.

 

- For mass market products or services, keep ad copy simple with short sentences and common words so it's understandable at an 8th to 10th grade reading level. Higher-end products can use longer sentences and more complex words targeting 11th grade level or higher. 

- The Fog Index can determine the reading grade level of ad copy by calculating the average sentence length and percentage of multi-syllable words in a sample. 

- Ad copy from bestselling books is around an 8th to 10th grade level, while magazines like Time, BusinessWeek and WSJ target 11th grade level. 

- Writing compelling copy involves becoming an expert in the product, understanding the target audience, crafting an attention-grabbing headline and subheadline, writing the body copy freely and then multiple rounds of tight editing. 

- Section 3 of the book will examine full ad examples to demonstrate how the principles taught earlier work in practice, allowing the reader to see how all the elements fit together and better understand techniques. Both good and bad examples will be analyzed.

 

This section summarizes and analyzes a classic 1973 direct mail advertisement written by Joe Karbo to promote his book "The Lazy Man's Way to Riches." 

The ad was highly successful, selling 3 million books. Karbo wrote it off the top of his head with little editing. 

The analysis examines how Karbo crafts the ad to slowly draw the reader in through short sentences, building curiosity about the offer. He establishes trust by being upfront about making a profit, and includes a strong satisfaction guarantee. 

Karbo justifies the purchase price without stating the offer, and builds more curiosity. He then shares details about his successful lifestyle to prove the system works, in a way that allows readers to relate to him. 

The analysis discusses how Karbo identifies with readers through descriptions of modest wealth and priorities like time with family. He sells the lifestyle benefits rather than specifics. 

The ad exemplifies direct response advertising principles like a good headline, building curiosity, identifying with readers, and proving results through personal storytelling according to the analysis.

 Here is a summary of the key points about Joe Karbo's life and advertising campaign:

- Joe Karbo was a direct mail marketer in the 1970s who achieved great success with a single direct mail advertisement. 

- The ad took an unusually long and upfront approach, providing a lot of details about Karbo's own experiences and background to establish trust and credibility with readers. 

- It emphasized that anyone could succeed using his methods, regardless of education, capital, talent, age or experience. This broadened the appeal to a mass market.

- Karbo included sworn statements from his accountant and bank references to further prove his honesty and legitimacy. 

- Readers who responded received a book containing Karbo's direct marketing techniques. The ad and book were quite successful over multiple runs in various publications. 

- Karbo attended one of Claude Hopkins' seminars in 1978 and shared the story behind writing his famous advertisement. 

- Sadly, Karbo passed away in 1980 at a young age from a heart attack during a TV interview that took an unfairly hostile turn. 

- His direct marketing teachings lived on through revised versions of his book published after his death. His original ad was seen as a classic example of Hopkins' direct response advertising principles.

 

- The passage discusses an advertisement for Royal Ruby Red grapefruit written by Frank Schultz. 

- The ad copy uses techniques like establishing credibility by mentioning Schultz is a farmer, creating curiosity with an intriguing opener, and telling the discovery story like a fairy tale. 

- It emphasizes the rarity and careful selection process of the grapefruit to build value. Schultz personally inspects each fruit for factors like size, color, and blemishes. 

- The description is detailed yet makes the complex fruit selection process seem simple. It activates the senses by mentioning taste.

- Schultz pitches the grapefruit by offering a sample shipment at no cost. This creates a satisfaction guarantee to eliminate risk for trying it. 

- The homey language like "right quick" adds authenticity. The ad copy masterfully uses storytelling, personal selling, and eliminating risk to persuade readers to purchase the rare grapefruit.

 

- The ad is for Victoria's Secret lingerie and is targeting men as customers to buy gifts for their wives/girlfriends. 

- It draws attention with the headline "Lingerie for Men" and piques curiosity with the subheadline about men making it possible. 

- On their first Valentine's Day, hundreds of men unexpectedly came to the store, drawn by the full-color catalog of beautiful lingerie models.

- The ad acknowledges the men may have felt embarrassed shopping in a women's lingerie store but that it was worth it for special gifts. 

- It notes Victoria's Secret is different than department stores, with no judgemental salespeople asking about sizes.  

- It broadens the market beyond the first customers to say any man who appreciates beauty in women could shop there. 

- The real pitch is to attract catalog customers from other states since stores were only in Northern California at the time. It uses sensual language to sell the catalog experience.

So in summary, it cleverly targets men as customers through an engaging story, addresses potential objections, and broadens the market before making the catalog pitch.

 

- The ad was for McDonnell Douglas promoting their DC-10 plane after it suffered some high-profile crashes. 

- The copy they used focused on technical details and praise from astronaut Pete Conrad but neglected to acknowledge the crashes upfront. 

- This was a missed opportunity as failing to address the main objection head-on weakened the message.

- A better approach would have been to openly discuss the crashes, outline the fixes made as a result, and then provide the technical reassurance. 

- By not raising and resolving the key objection, the ad came across as avoiding the real issue rather than sincerely addressing people's concerns. 

- In summary, acknowledging objections upfront and then providing thorough resolution comes across as more credible and persuasive than ignoring problems. This ad could have been strengthened by following that approach.

 

The message appreciates candor, honesty and frankness, as this will allow the other party to respond positively. Even if the message contains critiques or negatives about a product, being transparent and direct will help the other party understand the issue and work to improve it or restore confidence in it. An ally responding constructively to candid feedback, whether to purchase a product, develop goodwill with the company, or address public concerns about a product's safety, can help move in a positive direction.

 

- Joseph Sugarman had success selling his personal airplane through a single ad in a pilots magazine, getting his full asking price. 

- This encouraged him to try pushing the limits of mail order advertising by attempting to sell a $6 million home through a mail order ad.

- The strategy was to offer the home for sale, or alternatively a video about the home. If the home didn't sell, perhaps enough video sales could cover the ad costs.

- However, neither the home nor enough video sales materialized. The ad ended up being a financial loss for Sugarman. 

- It demonstrated that while mail order advertising could work in some cases like the airplane, there were still limits, as shipping an entire mansion was unrealistic even for an experienced marketer like Sugarman. It took the right product and right conditions for a mail order approach to be successful.

 

The passage describes an advertisement for an exclusive report from Budapest about a Hungarian conspiracy involving a new computer game called the "XL-25." The report warns Americans not to buy this game, claiming it is part of a plot by Hungary to weaken the U.S. economy and cause a major recession or depression. 

Specifically, the ad cites how the original Rubik's Cube puzzle caused widespread distraction and loss of productivity when introduced in the U.S. in 1980, helping trigger an economic recession. It then suggests Russian intelligence concluded such games could be weaponized by Hungary to undermine the American economy if new games like the XL-25 are mass marketed in the U.S. The passage builds intrigue about the supposed conspiracy but does not state whether the product is actually being sold until the very end.

 Here is a summary of the key points from the advertisement copy:

- The ad tells the story of how the founder discovered a new kind of sunglasses called BluBlockers through a friend who was impressed by how clear his vision was when wearing them. 

- When the founder tries them, he is amazed at how much sharper and clearer his vision is compared to his $100 sunglasses. 

- BluBlockers filter out ultraviolet and blue light waves, which have shorter wavelengths that can cause vision to focus in front of the retina. This makes objects appear sharper.

- UV light is also harmful to eyes and linked to eye diseases. Conventional sunglasses allow more UV light in as the pupils dilate. 

- The ad emphasizes the dramatic difference in vision quality between BluBlockers and other sunglasses and encourages readers to try them with a 30-day money back guarantee. 

- It aims to both educate readers on sunlight dangers and vision science, while launching the BluBlocker brand through this storytelling format. The ad was very successful in starting the company.

 Here is a summary of the key points from the book passage:

- The passage describes an advertising copy from 1978 called "Gold Space Chains" that caused controversy for being insensitive to women's issues. 

- The ad used a "salesman" character named Bob to pitch gold jewelry chains as gifts for women readers' wives/loved ones. It featured a photo of Bob's cousin modeling the chains.

- Many women complained about the ad. However, it was still commercially successful, likely due to rising gold prices after publication.

- The passage critiques aspects of the ad copy that could be seen as offensive, such as referring to the readership as "our good friend" and the use of Bob's cousin to persuade publication of the unrelated product.

- It notes how the ad departed from the catalog's normal focus on space-age technology products and discusses some of the back-and-forth persuasion portrayed in the copy.

- Overall the passage provides historical context about a controversial past ad and evaluates it through a modern lens focused on sensitivity and appropriateness.

 

- The company Consumers Hero is left with 2,000 unsold clock radios in its warehouse that it considers "lousy rotten".

- The proposal is to take these used clock radios, refurbish them through testing, repairing, cleaning, replacing worn parts, and placing a new label on them. This would cost around $3-7 per unit. 

- The refurbished units would then be sold to consumers for $20, representing a profit of around $10 per unit. Consumers are told they are getting a better product than the original for half the retail price.

- To avoid legal issues with selling stolen/refurbished goods, the company promises to make the products untraceable to their original brand or owner through the refurbishing process. 

- They form a private membership of consumers to sell the refurbished products to at discounted prices, ranging from 40-70% off retail. Longer warranties are also offered.

- The proposal relies on misleading consumers into believing they are getting a great deal on refurbished defective merchandise, while still making a large profit through the process. However, selling refurbished goods as new could be considered fraudulent.

 Here are some key points about writing copy for catalogs:

- The cover should feature a dramatic or novel product to catch attention. Include a personalized message from the owner/president to make it more human. 

- Describe products thoroughly with all salient features so customers can make an informed decision. Leaving anything out risks reducing sales.

- Craft copy as friendly personal conversations to match the store-like environment of catalogs. Use "I", "me", etc. rather than neutral third-person writing. 

- Feature multiple variations of a main product as catalogs allow, unlike mail order ads which focus on a single offer. 

- Set the catalog's visual style and environment based on the typical price points of products. Upscale looks for sophisticated buyers, not too slick for closeout catalogs.  

- Give important details more space. Include contact info like a phone number on every page in case customers want to ask questions or place an order.

The key is making catalogs feel welcoming, personable and thorough to guide buyers through the selection process with all necessary information at their fingertips.

 

- Using a toll-free phone number on marketing materials like catalogs makes it easy for prospects to order products and services. An easy-to-remember number like 1-800-GOFEDEX is best. Include both the word version and actual numbers. 

- The toll-free number should be prominently displayed on order forms so people know how to place an order over the phone or website. 

- Order forms can double as a record for customers to write down purchases before calling in their order. This makes the ordering process quicker.

- Insert materials like order fulfillment flyers, bounce backs, and broadsides are additional marketing pieces shipped with an order. They offer related products to new customers. 

- Direct mail focuses on targeting specific prospects with relevant offers. Keep the message personal using "I" rather than "we". Sign letters personally. 

- Test different direct mail elements like envelope messaging to see what drives open and response rates. Factors like list quality also impact results.

- For newspaper ads, mail order ads should cover their cost on the first insertion. Retail ads require frequency over time to build awareness and trust with prospects. Testing ad elements is also important for newspapers.

 

- Newspapers are effective for advertising local businesses like restaurants, car dealerships, stores, etc. due to their fast response time - ads can be placed quickly and customers respond within days. 

- Frequency is important for retail ads to remain top of mind. Consistency in format and scheduling also helps build recognition and response over time.

- Upscale papers like the WSJ work well for higher-priced products due to their affluent readership. 

- Catchy, compelling ads that grab attention are needed, especially for student audiences. The armored car ad example was very successful.

- Press releases should be written like news stories to appeal to editors. Include who, what, when, where, why details up front along with quotes to enhance the message. 

- Billboards require impactful headlines/graphics that convey the message instantly as people pass by quickly. Simplicity is key to capture attention in seconds. 

- Newspaper ads can profitably reach mass audiences, while niche papers target specific demographics. Testing different approaches helps optimize results.

 Here are the key points about writing copy for television:

- Length of copy will vary depending on the format - 30 seconds to 2 minutes for TV spots, longer for infomercials. 

- Price point is important - impulse items under $30 are well-suited for TV spots. 

- Value perception is critical. The offer must seem like too good a deal. 

- Simplicity is key. Keep the message and offer uncomplicated to avoid confusion. 

- Only one choice should be given in the commercial. Don't offer options that complicate the decision.

- Start with the core benefit or headline to immediately grab attention. 

- Emphasize the value and reasons to buy through facts, demonstrations, customer testimonials. 

- Include a strong call to action near the end, along with additional incentives to buy right away (e.g. free shipping).

- For TV spots, keep the message focused on benefits to drive the one clear call to action. Longer formats allow more details.

- Repetition is needed to drive the message home. Short attention spans require reinforcing the core selling points.

The format needs to be considered along with price point, perceived value, and simplicity of message when writing effective television copy.

 

- Infomercials (long-form TV commercials) allow 30 minutes to sell a product compared to shorter TV spots. They became popular in the 1980s when regulations were relaxed. 

- Products that work well for infomercials are in the $39-250 price range and have continuity/back-end sales potential through automatic shipments of related products. 

- It's important to identify with a popular TV format that fits the product and prospective audience. Examples given are reality shows, interview formats like Oprah.

- "Back-end sales" or "upsells" refer to opportunities to sell additional products when a customer calls to purchase. Copywriters can create scripts to increase average order value through upsells.

- Mailing lists from TV buyers represent opportunities for after-sale selling through print, direct mail, or telemarketing depending on how they originally purchased. Copywriters should leverage principles of dialogue and positive questions to encourage additional purchases.

Does this accurately summarize the key points regarding infomercials, back-end/upsell opportunities, and follow-up sales methods? Let me know if you need any part expanded on.

 

- The passage describes techniques for writing effective copy for telemarketing and home shopping TV pitches. 

- It recommends establishing rapport by getting short affirmative answers (e.g. "Yes, I did") to open the conversation and set the stage for gaining agreement. 

- Curiosity-inducing language like "something that would go nicely with your knife set" is suggested to capture interest without directly pitching the product yet. 

- Asking for confirmation ("Do you have a minute to talk?") seeks another affirmative answer to continue building rapport. 

- The sales pitch is then delivered, ideally leading to closing the sale by asking how many units the customer would like to purchase.

- The approach aims to gently guide the customer through a series of small "yes" responses in order to obtain their agreement to the larger purchase request by the end of the conversation. Building rapport and interest is prioritized over immediately launching into sales messaging.

 Here are the key points about using long-form copy and infomercials on the internet to promote products and book sales:

- Long-form copy (long letters/ezines) allows you to provide more value, information, and persuade the reader over multiple pages like long-copy print ads. Include "Buy Now" buttons throughout to make purchases easy. 

- Testimonials and video come alive more on the internet. Incorporate audio and video clips within the long-form copy.

- Infomercials work well on the internet by leveraging audio and video capabilities. Keep them shorter than TV due to shorter attention spans online. Include an "Order Now" button.

- Successful book promotion leverages the author's email list. Offer free gifts to those who buy the book on its release date to drive early sales and get on bestseller lists. Authors' friends help promote to their lists too in exchange for expanding their own lists.

 

- Joe Vitale promoted his new book by offering free gifts from his friends to people who signed up via their opt-in lists. Millions of people were contacted this way, which catapulted the book to #1 on Amazon. 

- Vitale says the gifts should be quality items that people would want on their own to drive sales. Even established authors like Wayne Dyer have used this promotion method. 

- Setting up a personal blog is a good way for copywriters to improve their writing skills and promote themselves. Blogs get attention from search engines and allow people to express themselves and share opinions. 

- A viral marketing campaign was run by Vitale's friend to promote the BluBlocker sunglasses brand. They created an online game featuring the brand that spread virally and got over 1.5 million hits worldwide, driving traffic to the website and increasing sales. 

- For online stores to succeed, they need to offer a simple purchasing process, ship items quickly, and provide detailed product descriptions to build trust and reduce returns. Keeping the checkout process short with few clicks also encourages purchases.

 

- The passage discusses the equal opportunities that the web provides for everyone, from aspiring entrepreneurs to experienced marketers. It allows for more efficient distribution, sales and marketing of products and services. 

- It notes that we are only at the beginning of this revolution enabled by the web. There is still a lot more potential for the web to be developed and new opportunities to emerge. 

- It highlights that the ability to communicate in writing is one of the keys to taking advantage of this emerging technology. The web can be used to enrich one's own life as well as the lives of others. 

- In conclusion, the passage emphasizes the opportunities presented by the web and new technologies, and encourages the reader to make use of their writing skills to tap into this fast-growing domain to enrich themselves and help others.

 Here is a summary of the key points about copywriting and direct marketing from the provided content:

- All elements of advertisements, including graphics, copy, layout, etc. should be designed to accomplish specific goals like getting the reader to read the first sentence, keep reading, and take the desired action. 

- Emotion plays a big role in copywriting. Words and stories should evoke feelings and every ad should feel like an emotional outpouring. Logic is used to justify the purchase after an emotional appeal.

- Psychological triggers like curiosity, fear, greed, etc. can be leveraged in copywriting to motivate readers. Triggers like credibility, value promises, and testimonials also influence readers. 

- Technical terms and explanations should be given clearly for products while anticipating and resolving objections readers may have. Features should be explained simply.

- Clear, compelling copy that flows logically and answers reader questions is important. Headlines, captions, testimonials and other elements can reinforce the message. 

- The length, style and flow of copy should create an environment conducive to the sale by compelling the reader to keep reading until taking the desired action. 

- Direct marketing requires a personalized, conversational style of copywriting from the writer to the reader as if questions were being answered face-to-face. 

- Copywriting is an mental, creative process that leverages psychology, emotions and logical persuasion to motivate readers and produce results for direct marketing campaigns. Testing is also important.

 Here is a summary of key points about copywriting from the passage:

- The goal of traffic and direct marketing advertisements is to get people to respond by placing an order. 

- Headlines are important for grabbing attention. Good headlines are attention-getting, integrate with the overall message, and have integrity. 

- The first sentence should be short, simple, and easily read. It sets the tone and pace for the rest of the copy.

- Human interest and drama help connect products to prospects. Graphic elements and photos can emphasize the human element.

- Curiosity is a powerful motivator that can be sparked through questions, assumptions of constraints, and mystery. 

- Benefits should be explained through simple product descriptions and educational messages. Technical jargon should be avoided.

- Emotion like fear, greed, guilt or hope can motivate action if used carefully. Storytelling effectively taps into emotion. 

- Benefits should be linked to prospects through familiar experiences or fads. This creates resonance and identity. 

- Objections should be anticipated and addressed through problem solving and satisfaction conviction. 

- Offers and calls to action help justify the purchase price through exclusivity, trials, or limited supplies. Urgency increases response rates.

- Testing, editing/polishing, and practicing are important for effectiveness. Mistakes are learning opportunities.
