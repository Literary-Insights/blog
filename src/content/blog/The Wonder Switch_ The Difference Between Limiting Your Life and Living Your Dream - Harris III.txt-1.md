- The book shares Harris III's expertise as a magician and storyteller to help readers rediscover wonder, which can transform our lives and work. Wonder fuels creativity, innovation and leadership. 

- As children we were naturally wonder-filled, but many lose that sense of wonder as adults due to life's challenges. The book aims to help the reader reawaken their inner sense of wonder. 

- Harris draws from brain science and discusses how our thoughts and imagination shape our reality. The stories we tell ourselves impact our mindset, behaviors and outcomes.

- He provides tools to change one's "old story" by examining the past with compassion, allowing for personal transformation. Readers learn to craft a new, empowering narrative. 

- Concepts like adopting a "wonder mindset" aimed at possibility rather than limits, and intentionally designing one's environment, are discussed as ways to cultivate more wonder in daily life. 

- Overall the book promotes moving from complacency to curiosity through embracing wonder again. This opens the reader to greater creativity, purpose and well-being in work and relationships.

 

The author discusses the concept of the "wonder switch" - an innate sense of curiosity, awe and imagination that is present in children but often gets switched off as they grow up. Having the wonder switch "on" leads to creativity, innovation and dreaming. 

Without wonder, life is ruled by cynicism, stress and worry. The author's goal is to help readers reawaken their sense of wonder. Turning the wonder switch back on can transform different areas of life, like leadership, parenting, and creativity. It increases empathy, belief in others, and ability to see possibilities. Without wonder, there is a risk of crushing one's own potential and the potential in others.

The author believes wonder is connected to all parts of life, from work and relationships to personal finances. Rekindling curiosity and imagination can ignite positive change in many domains. The book aims to illustrate how reconnecting with a sense of wonder can enhance well-being and fulfillment.

 

- The book is not a self-help guide on becoming an entrepreneur or growing a business, but wonder is important for those processes. The goal is to make the reader a healthier, happier person who can better love and help others. 

- Wonder is connected to empathy and emotional connection. Increasing wonder can increase capacity to give and receive love.

- Without wonder, curiosity dies and we settle for a stressful, anxious life. Lack of wonder breeds feelings of failure, shame, isolation, lack of connection, lack of hope, and feeling we don't belong or our dreams are out of reach.

- Wonder is a catalyst for change that "rescues us from the ordinary." It allows us to see things are extraordinary and believe in real magic. 

- The author hopes to equip readers to cultivate and sustain wonder, which exists in both joys and sorrows of life, not just mountaintops. 

- Stories and wonder are interconnected. The Transformation Map shows the process of changing an old story to a new, more hopeful one driven by wonder. 

- Socrates said "Wisdom begins in wonder." The author suggests becoming wise begins with reawakening wonder, and lack of wonder in the world breeds foolishness.

 

The passage discusses how wonder and wisdom can fade over time if certain forces are allowed to crush one's sense of wonder. It argues that while access to information has increased, true wisdom requires an openness to mystery and embracing the unknown. 

The author reflects on his own experience of having his wonder destroyed as a child by sexual abuse from a mentor. He recounts vivid memories of the traumatic event in disturbing detail. When asked a question at an event about forgiveness, it triggered painful flashbacks for the author.

Overall, the passage asserts that maintaining a sense of wonder is important for wisdom, growth and living purposefully. But wonder can be crushed by forces like fear, cynicism and trauma. The author draws on his own tragic past to illustrate how easily wonder can be destroyed, and the lifelong impacts that can result from crushing experiences in childhood.

 

The author had been sexually abused by his magic teacher, Bill, for about three years starting when he was around 13 years old. One evening in a motel room, Bill instructed the author to take off his pants under the guise of teaching him how to hide doves in his clothing for magic tricks. This made the author uncomfortable but he wanted to learn from Bill, who had been mentoring him for over a year. This began a period of abuse. 

The abuse shattered the author's innocence and led him down a path of exploring sexuality through pornography at a young age, as a way to make sense of and justify what happened to him. He kept the abuse secret for many years. Years later when speaking at an event, he was unexpectedly asked how to find strength to forgive someone for something terrible they did. In that moment, the author chose to share his story of abuse for the first time publicly. Speaking the truth was the beginning of his journey to heal and forgive Bill, not to excuse the actions but to accept what happened and move forward.

 

- The passage describes how as children, we are born with a sense of wonder and belief in magic. But as we grow up, various life experiences like abuse, trauma, pressure to conform can crush that childhood wonder. 

- The author was sexually abused by a magician he looked up to as a child. It took years for him to realize the full truth and extent of the abuse. Finding secret letters and confronting others revealed the "secret to the trick" of what really happened.

- As a child, he suppressed and hid his trauma out of fear of getting in trouble or others misunderstanding. He kept the abuse a secret for many years. 

- Going through his abuser's possessions after his death helped uncover more secrets and clarity about what really happened. It was freeing but also angering to fully acknowledge the truth. 

- The lies and secrets of the abuse essentially put him in a "straitjacket" that reshaped his identity and view of himself. It entangled his life until he discovered the truth that set him free. 

- He believes childhood wonder and belief in magic is crushed by life experiences like abuse, trauma, pressure to conform. But reawakening that sense of wonder can change one's perspective and potential.

 

- The passage reflects on how wonder and magic are lost as children grow up and are "educated out of their souls."

- The author recalls his first memory of experiencing wonder at age 9, when he received a box of magic tricks for Christmas instead of the baseball glove he wanted. 

- Performing a simple ball trick for his parents, he was surprised to see the awe and wonder in their reactions. This sparked his curiosity in magic and turned his "wonder switch" on.

- Reawakening wonder opens one's mind to new possibilities. For the author, it birthed a dream of becoming a magician. On the trip home, he daydreamed visions of success performing magic rather than escaping his small town life. 

- Wonder gave him the belief that his new dream could be possible, despite coming from a humble background. This marked a shift from his previous perspective of limited possibilities.

So in summary, the passage reflects on how wonder was reawakened for the author through an unexpected Christmas gift, shifting his mindset and dreams for the future.

 

- The magician performed a show at a high school gym, not wanting to be there but doing it to promote his evening show. 

- The principal asked him to "do some show-and-tell" and teach the kids how they are being tricked in their choices. 

- During the performance, a girl approached him afterwards with a razor blade, saying it was her "straitjacket" and she didn't want it anymore. She had scars on her wrists. 

- This sparked his curiosity to understand why people harm themselves. He began researching the role of advertising and how it influences identity and self-image. 

- He realized modern society is saturated with thousands of advertising messages per day telling people they are "not enough" unless they have certain products or live a certain lifestyle. 

- The experience prompted him to rethink using magic just for entertainment and seek a purpose of returning people to "real magic" by addressing issues like those that led the girl to self-harm.

 

- Advertising and marketing aim to sell more than just products - they tell stories to associate products with social acceptance, belonging, and identity. Character identification causes our brain to empathize with ads as if we experience what characters do. 

- We are naturally wired for storytelling as a survival mechanism. Our brain understands the world through narratives and fictional scenarios help us safely navigate social and emotional challenges. This is why story-driven advertising is so effective in influencing our beliefs and choices. 

- When we buy into counterfeit stories sold by ads that don't align with our true self, it can lead to unhappiness, loss of wonder, and even self-harm. Marketers meticulously design fictional ads and product associations to seem like reality. 

- Wonder and authentic storytelling have the power to shape our internal narratives and life choices in a positive way. Storytellers set the visions and agendas that generations follow. Regaining wonder can help rewrite the stories we tell ourselves.

In summary, the commercial argues that advertising uses fictional stories and character identification to sell counterfeit identities and realities, which can damage wonder and authenticity if fully bought into. Retaining wonder allows rewriting our internal stories in a truer, healthier way.

 

- Steve Jobs understood the power of stories. The iPhone was tremendously successful not just because it gave people more access to stories, but because it empowered people to tell their own stories. 

- The author writes about how as children we are praised for basic achievements, making us feel like we are enough. But at some point, the praise stops and we start to believe the lie that we are not enough. 

- He traces how different traumatic incidents in his life contributed to him believing this lie, such as being bullied, abused, and being bombarded by advertising implying he would be enough if he had certain things. 

- Even after achievements, he still felt the need to "put on a show" to prove to others and himself that he was enough. Social media amplifies this performance as likes provide a dopamine hit. 

- We compare our lives to idealized versions or others' highlight reels. The author says this comparison is often really to an idealized version of ourselves. Our sense of who we should be comes from narratives, some of which may be untrue or rooted in past trauma. 

- We need to examine the narratives that drive our choices and behavior, as untrue stories can keep our "wonder switch" turned off. Radical self-inquiry is needed to face past trauma and change our life story.

 

The passage discusses wonder and how cultivating wonder can lead to a more magical life. It notes that seeing is not always believing, and that our beliefs influence what we see. Wonder gives us permission to believe in possibilities we can't yet see. 

The passage then talks about the scientific connection between wonder and our physiology. Experiencing wonder has health benefits. It questions where wonder comes from, noting it's not something we can manufacture at will. 

To cultivate wonder, we need to expose the lies we tell ourselves and change our belief systems. We should redeem our senses and awaken our awareness so we are open to wonder when it arises. Spending more time in a state of wonder can change our perceptions and allow us to see more magic regularly. 

In summary, the passage advocates reawakening a sense of childlike wonder. It says this can lead to a more magical life by changing what we believe and helping us see possibilities we previously missed. Wonder is connected to our health and well-being, so cultivating it has benefits.

 

- Awe and wonder aren't always synonymous. You can feel awe without wonder, such as being speechless at something awful. 

- Spectacles can elicit awe but not necessarily transformational wonder. Wonder involves becoming a participant in a story rather than just an observer of an external event. 

- The author did not experience wonder during visits to Disney World as a cynical young adult, despite being amazed by the spectacles. 

- Watching the same Disney fireworks show with his young son allowed him to experience it through a child's sense of wonder, finding himself in the story being told. 

- Communal experiences may be more conducive to wonder, as awe leads to feelings of connectedness rather than individual pride. 

- Wonder is calming physiologically as it reduces fight-or-flight responses. It motivates a shift to taking in the greater whole rather than focusing inward.

- Emerging research shows experiences of awe and wonder enhance mental and physical health by reducing stress and inflammation. A sustained sense of wonder may act as a nutrient for our well-being. 

- Cultivating wonder could increase empathy, generosity, and improve divisive social issues through a shared sense of connectedness. Telling stories may help heal sick children by awakening their sense of wonder.

 

The criminal justice system in America could be restored through increased empathy and a willingness to objectively consider all the facts. Studies show experiences of awe and wonder can help with this by reducing self-focus and increasing openness to different narratives. Wonder gives permission to consider alternative stories and the possibility one's own view may be incomplete. 

Wonder could potentially help address the mental health epidemic by decreasing inflammation. Positive emotions like awe have been shown to reduce inflammatory cytokines in the body, whereas negative emotions increase inflammation and risk of disease over time. Emotional 'inflammation' from burying emotions can also lead to flare ups, addictions, and clinical depression.

Placebo effects demonstrate the power of the mind to heal the body through expectation and belief alone. Beliefs that become real can change ones expectations to meet reality rather than vice versa. Suggestibility through placebo, hypnosis, and other means shows how imagination and willpower can shape physical outcomes. While not a replacement for medicine, these factors indicate mindset plays a role in health and outcomes beyond what was previously thought. Rediscovering wonder, magic and possibility through openness to alternative narratives and experiences could support transformation in individuals and systems.

 

The author recounts visiting many famous landmarks and wonders of the world throughout his career in magic and illusion, but feeling more curious to figure them out than truly in awe or wonder. His perspective changed after a fire-breathing stunt went wrong and badly burned his face. 

While recovering, he began observing more of the magical sense of wonder in his young son Jude. Watching Jude experience simple things like blowing bubbles or catching fireflies with raw joy and curiosity made the author realize he had lost that childlike sense of magic and purpose in his own work. Interacting more with Jude helped the author rediscover his ability to truly see magic again.

This experience of rediscovering wonder through his son's eyes prompted the author to re-examine why he got into magic performance in the first place. It led him to commit to recapturing that spirit of magic and reminding audiences what is real, rather than just focusing on illusion and trickery. The story suggests getting back in touch with one's original "why" can help renew a sense of wonder and purpose.

 

- The author explores how imagination and fears are connected. At a STORY community event, attendees listed their top fears that prevent creative success - these were fears related to not meeting expectations, being judged negatively, rejection, making bad decisions, and disapproval from others. 

- These fears take over our imagination and absorb our creative energy. As social beings, we desire belongingness and fear rejection. This plays into the "show" we put on to fit in.

- The imagination is more complex than commonly believed. The "default network" that imagines scenarios based on experiences is found equally in both left and right brains, not just the right brain. Labeling someone as "more right-brain" doesn't accurately describe imagination.

- Imagination is our natural state as children, but it gets conditioned by experiences before age 10 related to shame and fears of not belonging. Our imagination can get hijacked by these fears. 

- The author wants to curate experiences through the STORY community to help people overcome these common worries and fears, and regain control of their imagination. Understanding imagination better can help with this.

So in summary, the passage explores the connection between imagination, fears, and creativity, and discusses efforts to help creative people overcome fears that hijack their imagination.

 

- Einstein said imagination is more important than knowledge because it allows us to envision possibilities beyond our current knowledge and experience. Our brains are wired to use imagination.

- Sir Ken Robinson argues that imagination is a uniquely human capacity that has allowed the development of diverse human culture and innovation. However, modern education systems tend to crush children's imagination. 

- Imagination can be used productively to dream, create, innovate, and solve problems. But it can also be used destructively through worry and anxiety. Worrying is mentally creating negative visions of the future that often do not come true. 

- We are all creative, but many people believe they lack creativity. In reality, everyone uses their imagination, even if sometimes in unproductive ways like worrying. With practice, we can channel imagination into more positive outlets. 

- Fear can be rational and protect us, or irrational and hold us back. Irrational fear is often future-oriented worrying that keeps imagination stuck in negative patterns rather than moving towards possibility. Managing fears is important for fully unleashing our imagination.

 

- Fear can serve an important protective purpose by signaling potential danger, like feeling afraid in a reckless driving situation. This type of fear is more physical and rational. 

- However, fear can also be unhealthy and irrational when stimulated by past wounding, shame, or perceived but not actual threats. This type of fear is rooted more in the mind. 

- Irrational fears often stem from traumatic past experiences and negative messages received from others. We retell stories from our past that feed worries and dark imaginations. 

- All problems essentially come down to "people problems" - how we relate to and seek approval from others. Things like insecurity, fear of not fitting in, and desire for love and belonging drive behaviors. 

- Making peace with oneself and having the courage to be authentic can help overcome fears of lacking approval. However, interpersonal relationships still matter according to theorist Alfred Adler's perspective.

So in summary, the passage discusses the protective and irrational aspects of fear, how past experiences and relationships shape fears, and how self-acceptance can help address fears rooted in seeking others' approval.

 

- The author admits to using their calendar as an excuse for not preparing adequately for a client presentation, which frustrated another team member who felt unprepared. 

- When we receive negative feedback, our natural reaction is to believe we did our best and the other person just doesn't understand us or like us. But upon reflection, we may realize we could have prioritized our time better.

- This defensiveness arises from a desire for love and belonging. Our imagination can create worst-case scenarios when we don't feel loved. This leads to worry rather than wonder. 

- To choose wonder over worry, we must accept ourselves and allow love into our lives through relationships. Love reduces fear and lifts us up. 

- Instead of creating drama in relationships, we could use our imagination for more constructive problems. Our brains seek drama when bored; we should engage in more positive creativity. 

- Trauma can be transformed into creative fuel through art therapy, music, writing and other experiential therapies. This shifts trauma from the limbic brain and stimulates creativity. 

- Even without trauma, fears plague our imaginations. Healing from the past through inner work can help reclaim lost wonder and empower our creativity. The words "what if" are powerful for igniting imaginative stories.

 

- The passage discusses the difference between a limiting mindset and a "Wonder Mindset". A limiting mindset believes limits can't be pushed, while a Wonder Mindset believes we have only scratched the surface of what's possible. 

- Developing a Wonder Mindset is important for transformation. It involves rewiring your brain by unlearning limits and rediscovering your capacity. 

- Your mindset determines your behavior and outlook. It shapes what you think is possible versus impossible. 

- Many struggle with limiting beliefs from past experiences. This leads to a "fixed mindset" where progress seems impossible. 

- Research shows our talents and intelligence are not fixed, contrary to common assumption. While we have limits, there is a huge gap between our current abilities and true human potential. 

- The goal is to shift from a fixed mindset of limits to a growth mindset of endless possibilities by aiming higher than you think you can achieve. A Wonder Mindset permits believing in what you haven't seen yet.

In summary, the passage discusses how developing a Wonder Mindset through rewiring your thinking can unlock more potential by pushing past perceived limits and barriers. A Wonder Mindset believes the best is yet to come rather than in the past.

 

- Carol Dweck's research identified two different mindsets - a fixed or limiting mindset that views qualities as set traits, and a growth or wonder mindset that sees them as developable. 

- A limiting mindset leads people to constantly seek validation and avoid challenges to prove their worth. This is exhausting and prevents growth. 

- A wonder mindset believes skills and talents can be cultivated through learning and challenges. This allows continuous self-improvement rather than just proving abilities. 

- The first step to a wonder mindset is embracing that you are average, not extraordinary. This gives permission to stop comparing and believe growth is possible through effort rather than innate talent alone. 

- Positioning yourself out of your depth means taking on challenges where you don't know what you're doing, enabling growth. Successful people often "make it up as they go."

- Praising the process over outcomes frames failures as learning opportunities. Adding "yet" to "I can't" makes goals incrementally achievable through continuous learning and effort over time. 

- A wonder mindset requires embracing failure as a form of growth, not evidence of lack of ability or worth. Outcomes matter less than continuously improving through challenges and learning.

 

- Carol Dweck encourages praising the process rather than only success. It is in struggling through the process that we gain perspective, wisdom and learning. 

- Coasting through without challenging ourselves does not allow for growth. We should be pushing our boundaries and trying new things instead of doing the bare minimum. 

- Failure can accelerate our learning if we view it as an opportunity rather than something to be crushed by. It is how we respond after failing that matters - do we get back up and keep trying?

- Developing a growth mindset allows us to embrace challenges and set bigger goals, which may lead to more failure but also more learning and growth. 

- Our brains are plastic and can be rewired through new experiences and habits. Visualization and practice can literally change the structure of our brains over time by forming new neural pathways. Struggling through challenges provides those experiences that drive neuroplasticity.

So in summary, the passage advocates embracing struggle and challenges in the process of growth and learning, as failure and overcoming obstacles is what drives meaningful change and the rewiring of our brains.

 Here are the key points from the summary:

- Researchers conducted a study where participants either physically played a piano exercise or just imagined playing it in their heads. Both groups showed the same expansion in the motor cortex region that controls finger movement, showing that imagination can physically change the brain.

- Another study tested basketball players' free throw shooting after physically practicing for 20 days, physically practicing just on the first and last days, or just visualizing practice every day. The visualization group showed almost as much improvement as the physical practice group. 

- Visualization helps strengthen neural pathways related to your goals and imagined future. This allows you to build new habits and beliefs that can make your visions a reality. However, visualization alone is not enough - you still need to take real action.

- The author practices visualization daily to imagine publishing a bestselling book and the experiences that come with that, like reading good reviews. This helps fuel their creative process and belief in their potential. 

- Beliefs shape habits, which shape life experiences. Developing a Wonder Mindset allows new beliefs and storylines to emerge, leading to different behavior patterns over time through repetition. Taking responsibility for one's life and choices is important for sustaining wonder and progress.

 

The passage describes dealing with a period of challenges and difficulties ("storms" that come to "ransack" one's optimism and sense of wonder). While this wasn't the first time facing such challenges, the author had developed healthier habits, routines, awareness, faith and character through life experiences that helped them weather this storm. 

A key to maintaining optimism was self-awareness - being present and tuned into one's thoughts and feelings. Developing mindfulness through meditation was important for gaining this awareness. Mindfulness involves paying attention to one's thoughts without judgment, to identify untrue stories and limiting beliefs that stem from past experiences. 

When limiting beliefs creep in during difficult times, the author suggests pressing pause, reflecting objectively on the situation rather than subjectively, and identifying the specific untrue parts of the story fueling that belief. Affirming the truth can help counteract the lies, but simply repeating affirmations may not work unless the underlying traumatic experiences are healed through a process like therapy. Developing awareness is an ongoing practice that helps one maintain optimism even during challenging "storms" in life.

 

The chapter discusses how your environment and atmosphere can impact your mindset and ability to cultivate wonder. Just as astronauts would experience shifts in mindset as their atmosphere changed during missions to the moon, we too are shaped by our surroundings. Places like Disneyland and casinos go to great lengths to carefully craft atmospheres that influence mood and behavior - keeping visitors engaged and spending time there. Changing your environment alone may not activate wonder, but once wonder is activated, your atmosphere becomes important for sustaining it. The author suggests auditing the culture around you to ensure it supports a state of wonder, otherwise it will be difficult to maintain a Wonder Mindset. Atmospheres have profound power over our attitudes, so surrounding ourselves with the right environments can fuel wonder and magic in our lives.

 

- The stories that Disney characters find themselves in often feature them wanting something more or different, which sparks their curiosity and wonder. For example, Ariel wanted to be part of the human world above water, and Jasmine felt constrained by her role as princess and wanted freedom. 

- Great brands like Apple design their stores and customer experiences to tell stories that influence how customers view themselves and the brand. Being in an Apple store sparks wonder and shows possibilities of their products. 

- Small businesses can also leverage atmosphere and storytelling. The seemingly average Magic Castle Hotel sparks wonder through exceptional customer service like their poolside "popsicle hotline" and free laundry service. This creates a magical experience that changes how guests see themselves.

- Surroundings shape the stories we tell ourselves. Places like Disney parks or the Magic Castle Hotel inspire wonder, while places like hospitals can increase fear if not thoughtfully designed. Intentionally designing supportive environments helps achieve goals by sparking wonder. 

- Changing environments may be necessary to align with the stories we want to live. Characters like Ariel couldn't thrive out of water, just as changing surroundings alone won't lead to different outcomes without internal shifts. 

- Transforming familiar surroundings with a "magic carpet ride" of fresh experiences can expand horizons. This inspires wonder and fuels pursuit of aspirations. Maintaining wonder requires compatible internal and external environments.

 

- The magician performs a trick where they make toilet paper disappear in front of a volunteer on stage. Despite looking closely, the volunteer can't see where the paper is going. 

- The audience has a different perspective - they can see the paper is actually being thrown over the volunteer's head, right in front of their face. But the volunteer is too distracted to notice. 

- No matter who the volunteer is, the trick always works because people are easily distracted. A simple redirection of focus is one of the magician's most powerful tools. 

- Having mirrors in the room would make the trick impossible, as it would give the volunteer a new perspective. The magician says people can act as mirrors to show the truth. 

- It's important to surround ourselves with trustworthy people who will tell us the honest truth about ourselves and our environment. Negative or critical voices can distort our perspective. 

- Our attention and focus are shaped by the influences around us, like the books we read and people we spend time with. We need to curate our environment and influences to have accurate mirrors that help us see clearly.

 Here are the key points from the summary:

- The passage describes creating a toxic work environment due to conflict and gossip among team members. This led to a difficult decision for the narrator. 

- As a leader, the narrator chose to "protect your culture" in order to sustain an environment of "wonder" without being "crushed" by toxicity.

- This required ending a work partnership, which was messy but allowed the positive culture to return over time. 

- The chapter talks about the importance of assessing one's environment and ensuring it aligns with one's goals and values. Toxic environments can hamper creativity and success. 

- Spending time in nature is recommended as a way to boost well-being, attention, creativity and lower stress. Changing environments can help shift perspectives and open up new possibilities.

- The story uses John F. Kennedy's moon landing challenge as an example of how stirring stories can inspire curiosity and drive accomplishments. Kennedy's initial disinterest changed due to broader sociopolitical factors and a desire for a new national narrative.

- In summary, it discusses how toxic environments undermine potential, and how carefully crafting positive, enriching surroundings aligned with one's goals and values can help unlock creativity and progress. Leadership requires protecting a culture conducive to growth.

 

- Kennedy sparked curiosity in America by announcing the goal of sending humans to the moon in the 1960s. This awakened public wonder and led to unprecedented levels of human achievement and innovation. 

- Science fiction writers had been telling space travel stories for years, though they seemed implausible at the time. Putting a man on the moon proved these dreams could become reality. 

- The ability to achieve such a goal teaches us about the power of curiosity. Studying the initial curiosity that drove the desire to reach the moon can provide valuable lessons. 

- Curiosity is "wonder in action." When we shift from wonder as a feeling to curiosity, we move from being to doing. Curiosity demands to be satisfied and drives us to learn, solve problems, and innovate. 

- Innovation is not just for businesses - it can apply to any aspect of our lives. Developing curiosity will help solve problems in our work and personal lives. 

- Everyone is creative; it's simply our brain's response to problems. Renowned figures like Einstein and da Vinci attributed their achievements more to passionate curiosity than innate talent. Cultivating curiosity breeds creativity and innovative problem-solving.

 

- Leonardo da Vinci used his curiosity and wonder to imagine inventions like helicopters and even cars, through careful observation and by asking "Why?". 

- Neil Armstrong echoed da Vinci's view that wonder fuels the desire to understand, helping push exploration forward in unexpected ways. 

- Curiosity pushes us to search, explore and end up in places we never imagined, without needing special talents - just a childlike sense of wonder. 

- In the modern world, "counterfeit curiosity" seeks answers immediately rather than embracing mystery. It wants tension release rather than exploration. 

- Genuine curiosity is more like jazz improvisation - letting creativity flow freely without inhibition or fear of failure. It's about the journey, not predefined goals or answers. 

- People often want the "how" immediately after wonder, seeking answers to avoid discomfort with mystery. But embracing "wow" before demanding "how" allows more creativity. 

- The author advocates cultivating both wonder and practical questions, in the right balance and order, to fully develop new ideas through a culture of curiosity.

 

- The passage discusses the importance of balancing an attitude of "wow" (curiosity, wonder, openness to possibilities) with an attitude of "how" (practicality, realism about limitations and challenges). 

- It argues that in the early creative/innovation process, one should let the "wow" stage breathe without rushing to "how" too quickly. It's important to spend time exploring possibilities without immediately focusing on potential problems or reasons something won't work. 

- Some individuals are more naturally "wow"-oriented while others are more "how"-oriented. Both personality types are valuable, but it's important to be aware of which one you are inclined toward and make sure "wow" has space to thrive before "how" sets in. 

- The language people use can indicate whether they are in "wow" or "how" mode. Phrases focusing on limitations and reasons something won't work signal a "how" perspective. 

- Balancing "wow" and "how" is important for effective leadership, relationships, parenting, creativity and problem-solving. Allowing wonder and curiosity to drive the early stages leads to more innovative outcomes.

- Developing a "wonder mindset" through curiosity helps fuel bold endeavors like following one's dreams or career aspirations. Cultivating environments where wonder can thrive also supports sustained creativity and innovation.

 

The book explores how people develop narratives and belief systems based on stories they've told themselves that may not be true. This leads to problematic habits and behaviors. Understanding this shows that most problems stem from flawed storytelling. 

The role of wonder in embracing new mindsets and environments that enable new, more positive stories is also examined. This process of changing one's story is called "story righting."

A 5-step process for moving from awakening wonder to achieving a magical life is outlined. The steps are:

1) Awaken - Wake up from old, limiting stories and reconnect with a sense of wonder. 

2) Aspire - Identify goals and dreams without worrying about obstacles yet. Vision the desired outcomes.

3) Act - Take practical steps to achieve aspirations through intentional practices and actions. 

4) Iterate - Repeat the process, making adjustments along the way based on experiences and learnings. 

5) Attain - Achieve aspirations by living fully into the new, empowering narrative.

The goal is not to say past stories were wrong, but to make them more complete. Understanding where one is in the "Transformation Map" process is important context. With willingness to do the work, one can transform their life by adopting a new, empowering story.

 

- The passage discusses the concept of "liminal space," which refers to the in-between time when one has left an old story or season of life but has not yet stepped fully into a new story. This can feel uncomfortable as there is no clear story. 

- Liminal space is where growth occurs. It's about the journey, not just the destination. Even if the next steps are unclear, one can embrace the mystery during this in-between time. 

- When transitioning from an old to a new story, it's normal and expected to get stuck from time to time in liminal space as the future is uncertain. But new plot twists that move the story forward are likely just ahead. 

- During liminal space, one should remain present to the current story and hold on to hope that what is anticipated will come to pass, even if doors are currently closed. Small actions over time can solve big problems. 

So in summary, the passage explains that the uncomfortable in-between period of transition is actually where personal growth and development takes place, and that remaining hopeful and active can help one progress through liminal space to a new story.

 

- The passage discusses an experiment where wild and domesticated rats were placed in water-filled jars to see how long they would swim before drowning. The domestic rats swam for days while the wild rats died within minutes, showing the importance of hope.

- It then connects this to the hope and wonder shown by the character Dory in Finding Nemo, which allowed her to keep swimming despite difficulties. 

- The author argues we seek meaning, purpose, love and belonging, which can lead us to do strange things and try to be "normal" to fit in. 

- However, we should welcome and embrace what makes us weird, as all the best people are considered a bit mad or crazy. Individual uniqueness is valuable.

- In summary, the passage discusses an experiment that demonstrated the power of hope, connects it to themes of wonder and individuality, and advocates welcoming one's "weirdness" rather than trying to appear normal. Embracing curiosity and imagination is encouraged.

 

The passage describes the author and his son Jude visiting Dave & Buster's arcade every Wednesday for months. They would win tickets playing games but Jude would only spend them on a pack of gummy bears each week. Eventually they amassed over 180,000 tickets stored digitally on their card. 

The author decides this will be their last trip and tells Jude he can get anything he wants. Jude surprises him by choosing a giant stuffed unicorn at the top of the prize shelf. The author is unsure but lets Jude get it. As they are leaving, Jude excitedly says his sister will love the unicorn.

This selfless act from Jude transforms the author. He realizes Jude's wonder and joy comes from sharing with others, not hoarding for himself. It reminds the author to see magic in ordinary things and others. The story advocates maintaining a sense of wonder like children do, and finding magic in everyday life and within yourself.
