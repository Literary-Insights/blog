 Here is a summary of the cover:

- The cover contains a title page, dedication, prologue, 16 chapters, epilogue, postscript, note on lexicon, acknowledgments, about the authors, photo credits, and a picture section. 

- The prologue describes the 6 weeks between the author's rape conviction and sentencing, during which he traveled and saw girlfriends. He knew he would likely face jail time, despite his promoter's assurances and attempts at divine intervention.

- The sentencing: The defense team submitted a thorough presentence memorandum and character testimonials on the author's behalf. However, the judge still sentenced him to jail time. During the trial and sentencing, the author exhibited a lack of humility. 

- The author's lawyer argued for a suspended sentence with probation at a halfway house, calling the director of one such facility to testify. However, the prosecutor got the director to admit there had been recent escapes, undermining this argument.

- The lawyer then spoke about the author's difficult childhood and adoption by a boxing trainer, though the author felt this trainer focused more on boxing than on him as a person.

The summary outlines the contents and events leading up to the sentencing, with additional context around the author's mindset and humility at the time. The actual sentence itself is not specified in this summary.

 

- Mike Tyson stood up in court for his sentencing after being convicted of raping Desiree Washington. 

- Tyson's lawyer Fuller had given a rambling closing argument. Now the prosecution recommended 8-10 years in prison. 

- Tyson muttered an insult under his breath when the judge sentenced him to 10 years for the rape count. She gave him the maximum sentence of 30 years (to run concurrently).

- The judge denied Tyson bail pending appeal. His lawyer Voyles told Tyson to hide his handcuffs from the media. But Tyson held up his cuffs defiantly for the cameras. 

- Tyson was processed into prison, undergoing a strip search and cavity search. He was consumed with rage and ready to show the other inmates "how to do time."

- Tyson reflects that the judge who sentenced him may have saved his life.

- Tyson then recounts an incident from his childhood in 1976. He and his friends, called The Cats, stole some guns to back up friends in an altercation with a group called the Puma Boys. While confronting them in the park, Tyson's older brother Rodney came upon them and told Tyson to leave, possibly saving his life. 

- Tyson says he was often in dangerous situations as a child in Brownsville, Brooklyn.

The summary covers the key details from Tyson's sentencing and prison intake, as well as the flashback to his childhood. The assistant extracts the most important events, statements, and outcomes while condensing the overall passage.

 

- The author was born on June 30, 1966 in Brooklyn, New York. He spent most of his early childhood in the hospital due to lung problems. 

- He doesn't know much about his family background. His mother, Lorna Mae, was from Virginia but moved to New York. His grandmother, Bertha, worked for a white family in the 1930s and used the money to send her kids to college. The author's mother completed three years of college before dropping out to care for his sick father.

- The author didn't know his father well. His birth certificate lists his father as Percel Tyson, but the author and his siblings were told their father was Jimmy "Curlee" Kirkpatrick Jr., who was barely in the picture. Curlee would visit periodically but didn't have much of a relationship with them. 

- The author's first neighborhood was Bedford-Stuyvesant in Brooklyn. His mother would host frequent card games and parties where people would gamble, drink, and do drugs. The author's brother, Rodney, was very different from him - Rodney was intellectual and studious while the author got into trouble. The author once cut Rodney with a razor during surgery "play."

- When the author was seven, his family was evicted from their apartment during a recession. They moved to the Brownsville neighborhood, which was much more dangerous and impoverished. The author witnessed a lot of violence and crime there. His mother had difficulty finding a job and descended into alcoholism. Life became very difficult for the family.

 

The passage describes the difficult and traumatic childhood of the narrator. He grew up in extreme poverty, living in condemned buildings without basic necessities like heat or water. His family moved frequently after being evicted from places. His mother had to rely on undesirable men at times to provide shelter and income. The narrator recalls sleeping in the same bed as his mother and one of her boyfriends as a child. 

The relationship between the narrator’s mother and her boyfriend Eddie was volatile and abusive. They would frequently get into violent physical fights, once resulting in Eddie punching the narrator’s mother so hard that he knocked out her gold tooth. During another fight, the narrator’s mother threw boiling water on Eddie, causing severe burns. Despite the abuse, Eddie stayed with the narrator’s mother. The narrator suggests that witnessing this unhealthy relationship contributed to his own “dysfunctional” relationships and views on relationships as an adult.

The narrator also endured bullying and abuse outside the home. He was bullied in school for his appearance and hygiene, as his family struggled with poverty. Other children would hit, kick, and rob him. One incident where bullies destroyed his glasses led the narrator to drop out of school at the age of seven. He recalls feeling helpless in the face of the constant abuse and bullying. 

Overall, the passage paints a disturbing portrait of the immense hardships, trauma, and violence that the narrator endured throughout his early childhood. The severe poverty, unstable housing, exposure to abusive relationships, and bullying left deep scars and impacted his psychological and emotional development.

 

The narrator first encounters pigeons and the men who keep them on the roof of his building when he is 7 years old. He begins helping the men by chasing away pigeons that land on other roofs and buying seed and cigarettes for them. He enjoys the pigeons and spending time on the roof. However, when he shows up the next day, the men become violent and throw bricks at him, telling him to leave. 

An older man named Barkim sees what happens and takes pity on the narrator. Barkim invites the narrator to join him in committing robberies and burglaries. The narrator begins breaking into houses through small windows and opening doors for Barkim. Barkim gives the narrator money and nice clothes from the robberies. The narrator meets the Rutland Road Crew, a group of young thieves, and begins committing robberies with them as well. 

Barkim acts as a father figure to the narrator and warns others in the neighborhood not to mess with him. The narrator continues robbing houses, even during school hours, and gives some of the money and goods to his friends. He enjoys the money, nice clothes, and status that comes with the robberies. 

One day, the narrator and his friend Curtis break into a house. The narrator thinks Curtis is joking around, so he responds, before realizing the homeowner is in the house. The narrator escapes, but Curtis is knocked out. They used to sell goods they stole to a store called Sal’s. 

Overall, the passage describes the narrator’s entry into a life of crime at a young age, seeking acceptance, belonging, and material goods. An older man named Barkim takes him under his wing and acts as a father figure, introducing him to more serious robberies and burglaries. The narrator joins a group of young thieves, the Rutland Road Crew, and begins regularly committing robberies, even during school hours.

 

- The narrator started stealing and robbing at a young age, around 11 years old. He would steal things from stores, rob houses, and pickpocket people. 

- He and his friends would dress nicely to avoid suspicion and blend in. They would even go into schools to rob people during lunch.

- After a while, the narrator started doing burglaries on his own in addition to stealing on the streets, though he found the thrill of street crime more exciting. He and his friends would target people to rob spontaneously. 

- Sometimes they would encounter competition from other thieves, leading to fights over territory or stolen goods. The narrator was not very skilled at pickpocketing and was better at robbing through force.

- The narrator's family knew he was stealing but felt powerless to stop him. He would give his mother and sister money and gifts from his stolen earnings. His mother felt he was too far gone to save.

- The narrator craved attention and status but was shy and awkward. After he stood up for himself in a fight for the first time at age 11, he gained respect and began frequently fighting others, sometimes in arranged fights for money. He started gaining a reputation as someone who would fight anyone.

- The narrator began attacking some of the people who had bullied him in the past, beating them up in retaliation for the humiliation they caused him years before. With his new ability to stand up for himself, his criminal behavior intensified.

The summary outlines the narrator's descent into crime and violence at a young age, his craving for status, and his acts of retaliation against former bullies. It captures the major events and themes around his criminal development and relationships with his family and community.

 

• The narrator began stealing and engaging in other criminal behavior at a young age, around 10 years old. He stole from people in his own neighborhood, including his own mother’s friends. His family had no hope for him and expected him to end up in jail. 

• His criminal behavior escalated over time. He began committing more brazen thefts and robberies. He didn’t seem to care about the consequences and thought he wouldn’t live past 16 anyway. He witnessed a lot of violence in his neighborhood and saw his criminal friends as courageous. 

• He had his first run-in with police at age 10 over a stolen credit card. His mother beat him in the police station. She would frequently beat him in public and in front of others. The police didn’t seem to care and sometimes didn’t even charge him after she beat him.

• One time, at age 11, he was shooting dice and won $600 from an 18-year-old. When the man refused to pay, they got into a fight. Even though the narrator was in the right, his mother beat him in the middle of the fight and took his money and gave it back to the other man. 

• Overall, the narrator depicts a chaotic and violent childhood surrounded by criminal behavior, where even his own mother frequently abused and beat him. He seemed destined to end up a criminal given the circumstances of his environment and upbringing.

 

The author describes his turbulent childhood and adolescence in Brownsville, Brooklyn during the 1970s. He frequently got into trouble, was arrested multiple times, and was often sent to juvenile detention facilities and group homes, though he rarely lasted more than a couple of days in them before running away. His mother seemed to have given up on him from an early age and showed him little love or affection. 

He describes an incident where he went to Times Square with some friends and one of them snatched a prostitute's purse, leading to the author's arrest and being sent to the Spofford juvenile detention center. However, he found many of his friends were also there, so he didn't find it too unpleasant. During one stay there, Muhammad Ali visited and inspired the author to want to become "great" someday.

However, after being released, the author continued his life of crime, pickpocketing people on the Staten Island ferry and robbing stores. He talks about how dangerous his neighborhood was becoming, with many of his friends dying or being seriously injured over small amounts of money or goods. Even as an 11-year-old, landlords and shopkeepers would attack him just because of his reputation. He describes an incident where a man put a shotgun to his groin and threatened to kill him if he caught him in the neighborhood again.

With his frequent arrests and lack of success in juvenile facilities, the authorities eventually ran out of places to send him within New York City. At the time of this part of the story, he is about to turn 13 years old.

 

- The author was sent to Tryon School for Boys, a juvenile facility, at age 12 due to getting into trouble frequently. 

- His mother was relieved he was sent away because grown men were coming to their house threatening to kill him.

- He got into trouble soon after arriving at Tryon and was sent to Elmwood, a lockdown facility for troubled kids. There he learned the kids there were voluntarily boxing with one of the counselors, Bobby Stewart, on weekends.

- He worked hard to earn the privilege to box with Stewart. Stewart knocked the wind out of him in their first session, teaching him an important lesson. Stewart saw his potential and introduced him to the legendary boxing trainer Cus D'Amato.

- Cus immediately said he could be the heavyweight champion of the world after seeing him spar for just a few minutes. Cus invited him to his home, where he lavished him with compliments and told him he could make him the youngest heavyweight champion ever if he listened to him.

- The author was thrilled by Cus's belief in him and the promise of a bright future. He started spending weekends at Cus's home, training and learning from him and other boxers. Cus's encouragement gave him hope and direction.

- Overall, the author was a troubled kid who seemed destined for a bad end until he met Bobby Stewart and Cus D'Amato. They recognized his potential, believed in him, and set him on a path to becoming a champion. Their mentorship changed the trajectory of his life.

 

- Camille Ewald was a Ukrainian lady who took care of Cus D’Amato’s house where Mike Tyson lived. 

- When Mike Tyson first moved in, he would steal money from Cus’s brother Teddy to buy weed. Cus and Teddy suspected it was Mike but Cus defended him.

- At first, Cus didn’t let Mike box and instead spent hours talking to him about the psychology of boxing and spirituality. Cus taught Mike about overcoming fear, controlling his mind and emotions, and having confidence. 

- Cus used visualization techniques to help Mike transcend his physical self and see his potential. Cus claimed he could also visualize the future and control events with his mind. He gave the example of willing Rocky Graziano to throw a punch that led to a knockout.

- Cus had Mike repeat affirmations like “The best fighter in the world. Nobody can beat me.” to build his confidence. Cus said confidence comes from visualizing success and testing yourself.

- Cus told Camille that Mike was the boxer he had been waiting for his whole life. Cus convinced Mike's mom to let Mike move in with him rather than return to Brooklyn after his release. Mike wanted to become the best fighter in the world, as Cus had taught him.

 

- The narrator was a troubled, uneducated black teenager who was labeled as “retarded.” Cus D’Amato, an elderly white man, took him under his wing and became his mentor and boxing trainer. 

- Cus had a hard life himself and could relate to the narrator. He was fearless, color-blind, and dedicated to helping underdogs and the disadvantaged. However, he was also paranoid and bitter.

- Cus was obsessed with boxing and saw it as a way to help people from poor backgrounds achieve success and recognition. He had previously guided Floyd Patterson to become the heavyweight champion.

- Cus took a special interest in the narrator and worked to build up his confidence and ego. Cus told the narrator that he had immense potential and promise in any field he chose. Cus’s encouragement and belief in the narrator was transformative.

The speaker had a difficult childhood and was traumatized by being bullied. He grew up feeling insecure and afraid. Cus D’Amato became a father figure to him and gave him confidence and purpose. Cus taught him many life lessons and instilled values in him beyond just boxing. Cus made him feel like they were on a mission together. 

Cus was an extremist and trained him very hard. The speaker was also extreme in his dedication and desire to succeed. He gave up everything to focus on boxing and achieving his goal of becoming heavyweight champion. He would spend hours watching old fight films to learn. He and Cus had a close bond, with Cus cooking him breakfast every morning. But Cus was aware of the age difference and tried to teach the speaker as much as possible while he still could. 

The speaker felt he was not only doing this for himself but also for Cus, to defend Cus’s pride and ego. The speaker had to sacrifice a normal teenage life, giving up girls, food, and sleep in order to achieve his goal. Cus assured him those things would come in time. The speaker was completely devoted to Cus and his training methods, even though others may have laughed at Cus’s unorthodox style. The speaker knew Cus understood him and was giving him an opportunity he would never have otherwise had.

In summary, the passage shows the speaker’s total devotion to Cus D’Amato and his training, which gave the speaker a purpose in life and a chance to escape his circumstances. Though the training was extreme, the speaker thrived under Cus’s guidance and teaching.

 

- Cus D’Amato’s training style focused heavily on defense. He taught his fighters to keep their hands up, slip punches, and avoid getting hit. He used tools like a slipbag and the “Willie” to help fighters practice dodging punches. 

- Although defense was emphasized, Cus still wanted his fighters to be exciting and aggressive. He wanted them to force opponents into mistakes and frustrate them. He focused on short, powerful punches and punching in quick combinations.

- Cus particularly admired Henry Armstrong’s relentless attacking style and ability to break opponents’ will. He wanted Tyson to emulate this approach.

- Cus frequently told Tyson that if he listened and worked hard enough, he could become greater than all the champions of the past. Tyson eagerly soaked in this praise and motivation.

- Although the narrator was successful in the ring, Cus continued to criticize him and point out his flaws and mistakes after fights.

That covers the key highlights and events in the summary. Please let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on any part of the summary.

 

- The narrator's mother was hospitalized and dying of cancer. He couldn't bear to see her in that condition, so he never actually visited her before she passed away. He lied to his sister and said their mother was doing well. 

- After his mother's death, the narrator started acting out and went on a "house-robbing spree" with some friends from his neighborhood. One friend, Barkim, encouraged him to go back to Catskill where Cus D'Amato had taken him in. Barkim said the "white people" there loved him and he had opportunities there.

- The narrator's sister eventually found out their mother had died and punched him for not telling her. Their mother's funeral was small and sad. The narrator promised her he would become famous. 

- The narrator's social worker came and took him back to Catskill. Cus D'Amato helped him grieve for his mother. Cus told him that he was now part of their family. Cus even stood up for the narrator when a visiting boxer from South Africa and his team came to train with Cus.

- However, the narrator "fucked up" about a month later by grabbing the butt of Teddy Atlas's 12-year-old sister-in-law. Atlas, who had been arguing with Cus over money and wanting the narrator to turn pro, confronted the narrator and held a gun to his head, firing it next to his ear. Cus then got rid of Atlas. The narrator's hearing took a while to come back.

 

- The speaker cared deeply about Teddy, who had taught him how to fight, but got angry at him and threatened to get back at him after Teddy assaulted his sister Camille. Teddy ended up moving away. 

- The speaker felt responsible for Teddy leaving and ruining their relationship. He started training with Kevin Rooney instead, Teddy's childhood friend. The speaker fought frequently in tournaments and wanted to win no matter the opponent or location.

- In 1982, the speaker suffered his first loss in a tournament at age 16 against a much older opponent. His trainer Cus D'Amato told him he had to face defeat to become a champion. The speaker won several more tournaments but felt robbed after losing a controversial decision in one.

- While training for the Olympics, a commentator interviewed Cus and the speaker. Cus said the speaker had the qualities to be a great fighter if he gained self-awareness and discipline. Cus said training the speaker gave him motivation to stay alive in his old age. The speaker said he just wanted to be alive in 10 years and that training was harder than actual fighting. He wanted to earn money as a professional to live a lavish lifestyle. 

- The speaker was bitter about the intense training required and not being allowed to compete in his natural weight class at the Olympics due to a feud between Cus and Olympic officials.

 

- Mike Tyson wanted to fight in an amateur tournament in the Dominican Republic, but his trainer Cus D’Amato refused to let him go due to safety concerns and because Tyson would have to use different trainers. To get back at Cus, the organizers told Cus that Tyson would have to fight in a lower weight class, so Tyson went on a fast to make weight. 

- Tyson had an intense training schedule preparing for the 1984 Olympic trials. He won several matches by knockout leading up to the trials. At the trials, he lost a controversial decision to Henry Tillman. He lost again to Tillman in a rematch at the Olympic Box-Offs, leading Cus to unsuccessfully try to get the decision overturned. Although Tyson didn’t make the Olympics, Cus still sent him to live with the Olympic team in LA so he could enjoy the experience.

- After the Olympics, Tyson was depressed and smoked marijuana, reminding him of when Cus had caught him smoking before and lectured him. Tyson decided to dedicate himself fully to becoming a great professional fighter. However, coming off the losses to Tillman, Tyson was not in high demand. Cus lamented that Tyson didn’t have an intimidating physique. Tyson vowed to become so feared that “the whole world is going to be afraid of me.”

- To support Tyson, Cus got his friends Jimmy Jacobs and Bill Cayton to provide funding. Jacobs was Cus’s close friend, while Cus disliked Cayton. Still, Cayton and Jacobs had experience managing fighters, so Cus worked with them to promote Tyson.

 

- Mike Tyson turned pro in March 1985 at age 18. His managers were Bill Cayton and Jimmy Jacobs, who had invested over $200,000 in his development. Cus D'Amato was his trainer and advisor.

- Tyson's first few fights were in Albany, NY, near where he grew up. He won them easily by knockout. His managers and D'Amato were focused on building up his experience and confidence. They didn't make much money from these early fights. 

- Tyson started fighting in bigger venues, like Atlantic City. He fought on ESPN a few times. Promoter Bob Arum didn't think much of Tyson's talent at first. D'Amato disliked Arum and his matchmakers.

- Tyson won his first several fights by knockout. D'Amato criticized him after some fights for showing off or not following instructions. Tyson felt D'Amato was hard to please. Their relationship was up and down.

- Cayton and Jacobs worked hard to promote Tyson. They made highlight reels of his knockouts and sent them to boxing writers around the country.

- By the end of 1985, Tyson was undefeated with a 7-0 record, all wins by knockout. But D'Amato remained dissatisfied at times with Tyson's performance and behavior. Tyson felt pressure to please D'Amato.

That covers the key highlights from that part of Mike Tyson's early pro career and his relationships with his managers and trainer Cus D'Amato. Let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on any part of the summary.

 Here’s a summary:

- Tyson continued to rack up wins and knockouts, improving to 8-0. He and his managers were courting the press to gain more recognition. Tyson started hanging out at Columbus, a trendy NYC restaurant, and meeting many celebrities. Though exciting, this worried Cus, who thought it might soften Tyson’s focus. 

- Tyson’s next fight was against Donnie Long, a tough opponent expected to test Tyson. But Tyson knocked him out in under 90 seconds. After the fight, Tyson taunted other heavyweights, telling them to “come and get some.”

- Tyson said he struggled interacting with women and rarely had sex. Once, when an opponent didn’t show up, Tyson went to a whorehouse. He had awkward sex with a prostitute there, who then asked him for his Edwin Rosario t-shirt.

- Tyson continued fighting frequently. He beat Robert Colay in 37 seconds and Sterling Benjamin shortly after. Though Cus was very ill, he attended the Benjamin fight. 

- Cus was hospitalized and told Tyson he was dying of pneumonia. Tyson was devastated and didn’t want to continue without Cus. But Cus said Tyson had to, or else Cus would “haunt [him] for the rest of [his] life.” Cus then cried, worrying over Camille, not Tyson’s success.

- In summary, Tyson was becoming a star, but struggled with women and his mentor Cus’s failing health. Though Tyson didn’t want to go on without Cus, Cus demanded that he did.

 

- Mike Tyson's mentor and trainer Cus D'Amato passed away shortly before Tyson's fight against Eddie Richardson. Tyson was devastated by D'Amato's death and struggled emotionally. 

- After D'Amato's death, Tyson's managers kept him busy with frequent fights to help him cope. Tyson defeated Richardson, then Conroy Nelson, Sammy Scaff, Mark Young, and Dave Jaco in quick succession.

- Though Tyson was winning, he missed D'Amato's guidance and criticism. He opened up about this to Camille Ewald and in an interview. 

- Tyson then fought Mike Jameson and Jesse Ferguson. Ferguson employed defensive tactics like excessive holding that made the fight difficult for Tyson. Tyson eventually won by TKO after breaking Ferguson's nose.

- In summary, in the months after Cus D'Amato's death, Tyson's managers kept him active with frequent fights. Though Tyson was successful, he struggled with the loss of D'Amato and missed his mentorship.

 

- After defeating Jesse Ferguson, Tyson made some controversial comments about trying to break Ferguson's nose so that the bone would go into his brain. His managers tried to restrict his comments after that. 

- Tyson's next fight was against Steve Zouski. Tyson injured his ear in training and had to be hospitalized for 10 days. While in the hospital, Tyson would go out partying at night against doctors' orders. 

- Tyson's fight against James Tillis was tough. Tyson wanted to quit at times but persevered and won by decision. His managers claimed it was just a "hurdle" for Tyson to prove he could go the distance.

- Tyson's next fight was his first on HBO and at Madison Square Garden, against Mitch Green. Tyson won easily but gave a melancholy interview beforehand, saying people didn't really want the life he had. He was displaying the attitude Cus D'Amato had instilled in him.

- Tyson's next fight was against Reggie Gross. Despite having severe bronchitis the day of the fight, Tyson's managers made sure the fight went on. Tyson scored two early knockdowns and the fight was stopped, though Gross complained about it being stopped.

- Tyson's next two opponents, Jose Ribalta and Alfonzo Ratliff, seemed to be lesser competition. Tyson dominated them easily. His managers and promoters were bringing his opponents' caliber down.

 

- Mike Tyson’s managers, Jimmy Jacobs and Bill Cayton, wanted him to get more knockouts to build up his reputation. Tyson obliged by knocking out William Hosea in 2 rounds and Lorenzo Boyd in 1 round. 

- Two weeks later, Tyson demolished Marvis Frazier, Joe Frazier’s son, in just 30 seconds. Though Tyson loved Marvis, the knockout win garnered attention. Tyson had just turned 20 and the plan was for him to become the youngest heavyweight champion by the end of 1986.

- While negotiating a title fight, Tyson fought Jose Ribalta. Though Ribalta was a tough opponent, Tyson knocked him down three times and won by stoppage in the 10th round. However, Ribalta’s body blows left Tyson feeling nauseous for hours after the fight. 

- Tyson’s team then scheduled a fight in Las Vegas to prepare him for fighting there later in the year for the title. However, Tyson suddenly told his trainer that he didn’t like Vegas and wanted to go home, though he was likely just feeling anxious. His trainer handled the situation and Tyson stayed, going on to knock out Alfonzo Ratliff in 2 rounds.

- With the win, Tyson earned the right to fight Trevor Berbick for the title on November 22, 1986. In the lead up, Tyson made appearances on talk shows to promote the fight, receiving praise and advice from former champion Jake LaMotta. Though Tyson’s managers wanted him to appear charming, Tyson personally wanted to cultivate an image as a “villain.”

- Tyson trained hard for the fight and studied footage of Berbick. Though overconfident, Tyson wanted to “decimate” Berbick to gain respect. The day before the fight, Tyson realized he had gonorrhea but received treatment. At the weigh-in, Tyson acted aggressively toward Berbick. Tyson’s team, and the voice of Cus D’Amato in his head, believed Berbick would be an easy opponent.

 

- Mike Tyson did not like his opponent Trevor Berbick and was disrespectful towards him before their fight. Tyson predicted he would knock Berbick out in two rounds. 

- Tyson’s trainer Cus D’Amato disliked Berbick’s trainer Angelo Dundee. Dundee boasted Berbick would beat Tyson. This angered Tyson.

- Tyson couldn’t sleep the night before the fight. He talked to girls on the phone to distract himself but they only wanted to discuss the fight. Tyson then shadowboxed in his room.

- On fight day, Tyson ate pasta, steak and had a Snickers bar. He walked to the ring listening to “In the Air Tonight” by Phil Collins in his head. 

- Muhammad Ali told Tyson to “kick his ass” for him since Ali had lost to Berbick previously. Tyson said it would be “easy.”

- In the first round, Tyson hit Berbick with hard shots. By the end of the round, Berbick seemed dazed. In the second round, Tyson knocked Berbick down twice. The referee stopped the fight. 

- Tyson was numb after winning. He couldn’t believe he was champion at 20 years old. He dedicated the win to Cus D’Amato. Tyson said the win would make him immortal.

- At the press conference, Tyson said he didn’t care who he fought next and wanted to fight everyone. He praised Cus D’Amato as a genius.

- After the fight, Tyson went out drinking while wearing the championship belt. He visited different women but mostly just hung out with them. Tyson said he was just a kid having fun.

- Tyson said he felt lost without Cus to guide him. Winning the belt was his mission with Cus. After accomplishing it, Tyson felt free but knew freedom was dangerous without guidance.

- Despite filming anti-drug PSAs, Tyson was helping finance a friend’s crack cocaine business.

 Here’s a summary:

- The narrator grew up with Albert in Brownsville, Brooklyn in the 1980s. The area was dangerous and violent at the time, dominated by the drug trade.

- Albert was involved in the drug business, so the narrator gave him money so Albert didn’t have to work for dangerous drug dealers. However, Albert was later killed at a young age, along with some of the narrator’s other friends. The narrator paid for many of their funerals.

- After becoming heavyweight champion, the narrator showed off his belt around Catskill and poured champagne on his former trainer Cus D’Amato’s grave. He also had his mother’s remains moved into a nicer casket and bought her an elaborate headstone. 

- The narrator felt conflicted after becoming champion. He felt like his managers and promoters were trying to change his image and make him into someone he wasn’t. He wanted to embrace his roots in Brownsville but they wanted him to have a more wholesome image. He felt like “a trained monkey” and restricted in how he could act.

- The narrator frequently returned to Brownsville and gave away money and gifts to people there. He felt obligated to help people from his old neighborhood even after becoming successful. He didn’t think he deserved his success and money, so he tried to spread it around. He gave cash to homeless people, bought sneakers for kids, and made sure to give money to his mother’s old friends. He was looking for redemption.

- The narrator’s friends in Brownsville helped keep him grounded. They reminded him of where he came from and how much worse off he could have been. The narrator was even able to visit friends incarcerated at a nearby prison and hang out with them in their cells.

That covers the key highlights and events in the passage. Let me know if you would like me to explain or expand on any part of the summary.

 

- The narrator was leading a double life, sometimes visiting friends in prison and other times hanging out with celebrities like Rick James. 

- Rick James was eccentric and didn’t care what people thought of him. Once, he put his feet up on Eddie Murphy’s furniture even after Eddie asked him not to. When Eddie’s brother Charlie tried to restrain Rick, Rick punched him so hard he left the imprint of his ring on Charlie’s face.

- Anthony Michael Hall mentored the narrator in how to live like a celebrity. The narrator would pile girls into his limo and take them to his apartment.

- The narrator’s pimp childhood friend told him not to sleep with the prostitutes he worked with. The narrator didn’t know how to properly approach most women. His celebrity status made women more aggressive in approaching him, which made him think all the women wanted to sleep with him.

- The narrator didn’t know how to read women’s intentions and would make plans to take women on dates rather than just inviting them to his place. He was naive and awkward with women. 

- Older male celebrities would invite the narrator to bring women to their hotel rooms for group dinners. When the narrator started having sex, he did it frequently and with many partners, trying to satisfy them all. He kept a “Rolodex” of girls in different cities.

- The narrator met a young model named Naomi through a friend. She seemed interested in the narrator, who was intrigued by her beauty and success.

 

- The narrator met Naomi Campbell at a party and they started dating. They had a passionate relationship but fought a lot and weren’t meant to be together long-term. 

- The narrator was juggling relationships with multiple women at the time, including Suzette Charles, the runner-up to Miss America who took over the crown when nude photos of Vanessa Williams were published. 

- The narrator saw Robin Givens on TV and arranged to meet her for dinner. He felt strong chemistry with her and slept with her quickly. Robin and her family seemed focused on her marrying someone famous and wealthy. 

- The narrator defended his uneventful fight against James “Bonecrusher” Smith, saying Smith just didn’t want to fight and kept holding him. The narrator won easily despite being in pain from a pinched nerve.

- The narrator started feeling alienated from his celebrity lifestyle after becoming famous. He missed being able to talk to Cus D’Amato about things. In an interview, the narrator said women only wanted him for his money and fame, not because he was a “nice guy.”

- The narrator was falling in love with Robin Givens, remembering the exact moment it happened as they walked down Wilshire Boulevard.

 

• Mike Tyson was in a relationship with Robin Givens, an actress he met at a party. He fell hard for her even though she teased and manipulated him. The relationship was tumultuous, with frequent fighting and breakups. 

• Tyson had his next fight against Pinklon Thomas in May 1987. At the press conference, Tyson behaved erratically, threatening Thomas and then fawning over Givens when she showed up. During the fight, Tyson didn’t perform as well as expected but ended up winning by a knockout in the sixth round. 

• Tyson continued seeing Givens but was constantly cheating on her. When she caught him, they would have explosive fights where she would attack him and he would hit her back. The violence reminded Tyson of his mother’s unhealthy relationships.

• Tyson was feeling stressed from constantly having to prove himself as the world champion and from his toxic relationship with Givens. His hair was falling out due to alopecia. He told his trainer Steve Lott that he wanted to retire.

• Tyson felt insecure in his role as the dominant champion. When he went out to bars, people would tell him he had to win his next fight or they would lose everything. He felt he wasn’t good enough for the responsibility. He frequently got into fights at rough bars, risking his safety.

• Tyson’s next big fight was against Tony Tucker to unify all three heavyweight titles. But a month before the fight, the pressure had built up and Tyson was questioning whether he wanted to continue.

 

• Mike Tyson was attracted to dangerous situations and felt most comfortable in rough neighborhoods, despite the risks. He went missing from training camp for two weeks before his fight against Tony Tucker, partying heavily in Albany. He failed to train properly and struggled in the fight but still won by decision. 

• Tyson hated Tyrell Biggs, who had won Olympic gold when Tyson was denied the chance to compete. Tyson punished Biggs brutally over seven rounds in their fight, prolonging the beating to hurt Biggs and embarrass him. Tyson later regretted his actions.

• Tyson’s fight against Larry Holmes was highly anticipated. Tyson trained hard and broke ticket sale records. He was aggressive at the press conference, while Holmes was arrogant. In the fight, Tyson dominated and knocked Holmes out in the fourth round. After the fight, Tyson and Holmes exchanged insults. 

• Tyson was modest at the post-fight press conference, attributing his win to Holmes being past his prime. After the fight, Barbra Streisand and Don Johnson visited Tyson in his dressing room. Tyson admired Streisand, who was also from Brooklyn.

• The summary shows that at this point in his career, Tyson struggled with discipline and still acted out in cruel ways against his opponents. His humble statements after fights seemed insincere, though he genuinely respected and connected with certain people like Streisand due to their Brooklyn roots. Tyson continued to seek danger and chaos outside the ring, threatening his success inside of it.

 

- The narrator, Mike, is a 21-year-old boxer enjoying the perks of fame. He tells Barbra Streisand he thinks she has a sexy nose.

- Mike's trainer, Cus, told him he could have anything he wanted, including women. Mike lives a lavish lifestyle, dating models and partying. 

- Soon, the fame becomes difficult. He can't go out in public without getting mobbed by fans. His performance starts to suffer in the ring. He realizes you can't be a champion athlete and live such an indulgent lifestyle.

- Mike gets married to Robin after being told she's pregnant. Though there were doubts the child was his, Mike wanted to do the "honorable" thing. After getting married, Robin's mother threatens to force them to Vegas to re-marry unless they have a legal ceremony immediately. They legally marry in New York.

- Mike meets Iceberg Slim, a famous pimp and author. Though Iceberg led a harsh life, he's educated and well-spoken. He tells Mike stories of his past, though he now regrets that life. Mike asks if Iceberg was the best pimp. Iceberg says no, he was just educated enough to write about it. The real pimps were "monsters."

- Iceberg used brutal methods to control his prostitutes, like beating them with a heated clothes hanger. Though pimps seem ridiculous, they have immense confidence that allows them to control women. People envy that kind of confidence and manipulation.

 

- Mike Tyson had a close relationship with a pimp named Iceberg Slim when Tyson was younger. Tyson idolized Iceberg Slim and saw him as a mentor figure. 

- Even after Tyson became famous and wealthy as a boxer, he continued to visit Iceberg Slim, who lived in a dilapidated apartment. Tyson and others would sit at Iceberg Slim's feet and listen to him impart wisdom. During one visit, Iceberg Slim lectured Tyson about how he gives too much of himself to women and will always have "women problems" as a result.

- When Iceberg Slim was dying, he told Tyson that he wanted an above-ground coffin so that insects wouldn't eat his body. Tyson gave Iceberg Slim $25,000 in cash to pay for this. Iceberg Slim didn't thank Tyson for the money.

- Shortly after marrying his first wife, Robin Givens, Tyson had to travel to New York City to sign a new managerial contract with his managers Bill Cayton and Jimmy Jacobs. Jacobs had been hiding the fact that he had leukemia for 9 years. 

- A few days after the signing, Robin Givens called Tyson and told him that Jimmy Jacobs had died. Tyson was extremely upset, as Jacobs was like a brother to him after Cus D'Amato's death. Jacobs had hidden his illness from Tyson the entire time.

The key point is that Tyson felt betrayed and hurt by the death of Jimmy Jacobs, who had been suffering from leukemia for years without telling Tyson. Tyson looked up to Jacobs, and Jacobs's death left Tyson feeling alone and without guidance.

 

- After Jimmy Jacobs died, Mike Tyson felt like everyone was trying to take control of him and his money. His wife Robin Givens and her mother Ruth started making demands and trying to cut out his manager Bill Cayton.

- Tyson bought Robin expensive gifts like jewelry, clothes, and a BMW. Ruth and Robin got financial records from Cayton and had their lawyer file a lawsuit to remove him as Tyson's manager.

- Tyson felt conflicted and stressed. He told Shelly Finkel he felt like killing Robin or Cayton. He felt Robin and Ruth had set him up from the beginning. 

- Two weeks before Tyson's fight with Michael Spinks, Ruth's assistant Olga called a reporter and claimed Tyson physically abused Robin and Ruth. Olga and Robin's sister Stephanie gave similar stories, saying Tyson hit Robin but "just wasn't socialized."

- The reporter met with Ruth, who claimed Tyson broke things and hit Robin. But the reporter had secretly recorded the conversation.

- Tyson felt trapped with nowhere to turn. He couldn't trust Cayton but also couldn't get away from Robin and Ruth. He felt confused and taken advantage of by everyone.

The key events are:

1) Robin, Ruth, and their lawyer gain more control over Tyson's finances and try to cut out Cayton.

2) Tyson grows increasingly stressed, troubled, and feels manipulated.

3) Olga and Stephanie make abuse allegations against Tyson to a reporter. But their stories seem orchestrated.  

4) The reporter secretly records Ruth also making dubious abuse claims against Tyson.

5) Tyson feels trapped between Cayton, Robin, and Ruth - surrounded by people trying to take advantage of him.

 

• Mike Tyson’s wife Robin and mother-in-law Ruth gave an interview claiming that Mike had physically abused them. They later claimed they were misquoted. This added more chaos and drama to Mike’s life as he was preparing to fight Leon Spinks. 

• Mike felt betrayed by his family and alone without Cus. He was distrustful of everyone around him and primarily motivated by money. He lamented how things used to be like a family before Cus died. 

• The media and public did not give Mike much of a chance to beat Spinks. Mike used this as motivation and tried to intimidate Spinks at every turn. Spinks seemed rattled by Mike’s tactics.

• Before the fight, Mike met his hero Roberto Duran, who gave him advice to be patient. Mike was confident going into the fight. 

• Spinks’ team tried to mess with Mike by demanding his gloves be re-taped. Mike refused and they were cleared by the boxing commissioner.

• Mike walked out for the fight to funeral music to try and intimidate Spinks. Once in the ring, Mike could see Spinks was defeated. 

• Mike knocked Spinks out in the first round. In the post-fight press conference, Mike said he could beat any man and that this might be his last fight.

• The chaos, drama, and betrayals in Mike’s life fueled his determination and killer instinct in the ring. His out-of-ring life was spiraling out of control, but he remained dominant in the ring.

 Here is a summary of the statements:

- The speaker didn’t want to fight again until his life was in order. He knew he had to get rid of the women in his life and his management team. He wanted a fresh start.

- The speaker attended an after-party where many celebrities showed up, including his sister Denise. Although he tried to avoid her, she called out to him and bossed him around in front of others, demanding a Diet Coke. Although embarrassing, the speaker notes that his sister always worried about him and was an awesome person. She was simple and easily impressed, happy to meet famous people. She frequently called the speaker to demand favors and share unimportant details about her life. 

- After a fight, the speaker would visit Cus D’Amato’s grave and leave a bottle of champagne, which Rooney, another associate, did not approve of. There were many people making money off the speaker, leading to disputes that were eventually resolved when contracts were renegotiated. The speaker refused to immediately schedule another fight, wanting time off.

- The speaker spent more time with Don King, who had gotten the speaker to sign a secret promotional contract. The women in the speaker’s life had enlisted Donald Trump to help in legal matters but Trump did not have enough knowledge about the boxing industry. The women then tried to get the speaker committed to a psychiatric ward to gain control of his finances.

- One night, the speaker encountered Mitch Green, a former opponent, at Dapper Dan’s clothing store. Green confronted and insulted the speaker, who tried to remain calm but ultimately beat up Green when provoked. The violent encounter only ended after the speaker knocked Green out.

 

- The narrator gets into a fight with Mitch Green and badly injures him. A few days later, the narrator sees Mitch Green again while on a date with an “Afrocentric” woman named Egypt/Somalia. Mitch Green confronts the narrator but a fight is avoided. 

- The narrator stages a “suicide attempt” by crashing his car to get attention from Robin Givens. However, he hits his head and loses consciousness, requiring hospitalization. Robin Givens and her associates use this incident to portray the narrator as mentally unfit and spread stories about him being violent and suicidal to the press.

- The narrator, Robin Givens, and her mother travel to Moscow for Givens’ sitcom filming. Despite later claims to the contrary, the narrator behaves well there according to witnesses. 

- After returning from Moscow, Givens and her associates continue spreading stories about the narrator’s supposed erratic and violent behavior. However, these stories are shown to be false when checked by reporters. The narrator believes Givens is trying to have him declared incompetent so she can control his money.

- The narrator realizes that Givens does not actually care about him and is only using him for money and fame. He comes to deeply regret his relationship with her.

The key points are:

1) The narrator gets into an altercation with Mitch Green and injures him.

2) The narrator stages a minor car accident to get attention but ends up hospitalized. Givens uses this to portray him as unhinged.

3) Givens spreads false stories of the narrator’s supposed violence and mental issues to manipulate him. 

4) The narrator realizes Givens does not care for him and only wants his money. He regrets becoming involved with her.

5) The narrator’s trip to Moscow shows that Givens’ stories of his behavior there were untrue.

- After the interview aired, Mike got many calls from friends. In anger, he broke glasses, plates and champagne bottles in his New Jersey house. The police were called. Robin showed a police officer the damage and said she was concerned for Mike. Mike yelled that he could do what he wanted with his own property. He then threw a brass ornament through a window.

- Bill Cayton was still technically his manager but out of the picture. Jimmy Jacobs had died. The author thinks they took advantage of him but weren’t evil. He wanted independence. 

- He then worked with Don King, describing him as a “reptilian motherfucker.” King was greedy and outsmarted the author, who was out of his league. But King gave him freedom and instilled paranoia that white people were out to get them. The author went along with it.

- A trip to Mexico opened the author’s eyes to extreme poverty. He had thought no one could be poorer than him, so he was mad at them for proving him wrong. His success came from shame over poverty. His ego and feeling of deserving things led to problems. Cus tried to get him to transcend that.

- He was still seeing his ex-wife Robin Givens, though they were going through a divorce. Once, he caught her with Brad Pitt coming out of her house. She had also set him up by telling the media he was stalking her in Vancouver while she was filming a movie. Their divorce was finalized on Valentine’s Day.

- The narrator felt down after the divorce but had to focus on his upcoming fight against Frank Bruno. Though he tried to sound confident at press conferences, he was in no shape mentally to fight and didn’t train seriously. However, he knew he could beat Bruno since he had sparred with him as a teen.

- At the weigh-in, Bruno tried to intimidate him, so he pulled down his shorts in response. In the fight, the narrator dropped Bruno with the first punch but then got reckless trying to finish him and got hit by a few punches, though they didn’t hurt him. He then regained control of the fight.

- The fighter's friends would plead with him not to assault Don King, fearing retaliation. The fighter recalled kicking King in the head so hard "dust came out of his Afro." He once demanded King give him $1 million in cash, even though banks were closed, so he would have an excuse to assault him.

That covers the key details and events in the summary. Please let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on any part of the summary.

- A week later, B found out Desiree was accusing him of rape. His friend hired him a lawyer named Vince Fuller to defend him. 
- B had to testify before a grand jury who voted 5-1 to indict him on one count of rape and other charges. He faced up to 60 years in jail. 
- While preparing for his trial, B ate a lot due to stress and nerves. He had been training for a fight but tore cartilage in his ribs, allowing him to postpone the fight. 
- The prosecution hired an independent prosecutor to try B's case.

 

- Greg Garrison, the lead prosecutor, was a former deputy prosecutor known for prosecuting drug dealers. He took on this high-profile rape case to gain fame and glory. 

- Garrison examined Desiree Washington’s panties and believed the bloodstains showed she had put them on hurriedly after sex, indicating she had been raped. He thought her vaginal abrasions also showed non-consensual sex.

- Garrison and his team investigated the case thoroughly. They met with Desiree and her family, who seemed very polite and genteel. Desiree told them she went to the bathroom to get away from me after I “turned mean.”

- Garrison also spoke with Charlie Neal, who saw no signs Desiree was upset after the alleged rape. José Torres, an old friend of mine, claimed boxers were liars and I was the biggest liar. Torres said I was capable of rape and took what I wanted. 

- At her deposition, Desiree was reduced to tears by aggressive questioning from my co-counsel Kathleen Beggs. 

- The jury selection favored the prosecution. The judge, Patricia Gifford, helped craft rape shield laws and had prosecuted rape cases. Most potential jurors were white. The defense had trouble and ended up with a very conservative foreman.

- In opening statements, Garrison gave a graphic description of the alleged rape to portray Desiree as an innocent victim. In contrast, Fuller’s dry opening for the defense promised the jury would hear from me, a major error. Fuller did not even make eye contact with me, showing a lack of rapport.

- Desiree testified I asked her to go “sightseeing” in the limo but then turned “weird and mean” once in the bedroom. She went to the bathroom to get away from me. Her testimony differed from what she had told others.

 

- Desiree Washington accused Mike Tyson of raping her in his hotel room. 

- During the trial, Washington testified that she told Tyson "no" multiple times and asked him to stop, but he overpowered her and raped her. Her testimony seemed very credible to many.

- However, others thought Washington seemed too stoic and "perfect." Tyson's defense attorney, Vince Fuller, did not aggressively cross-examine Washington, to the surprise of many. He took a very passive approach.

- The emergency room doctor found two small abrasions in Washington's vagina, which he said were consistent with rape. The prosecution also showed graphic photos of Washington's vagina to the jury.

- Tyson's defense strategy was to paint him as a crude and vulgar womanizer. They tried to show that Washington should have known Tyson only wanted sex. However, this strategy was seen as racist by some and turned the jury against Tyson.

- Tyson testified on his own behalf but came across as arrogant and hostile. His use of crude language seemed to further alienate the jury.

- The jury deliberated for less than 9 hours before convicting Tyson of rape. Many saw the trial as unfair due to the pro-prosecution judge, potentially withheld evidence, and incompetent defense. The all-white jury and prosecution's use of racial stereotypes were also seen as prejudiced by some.

- Tyson maintained his innocence but said he knew the "mentality" of the court would lead to a quick conviction. The jury foreman said the issue of consent was "clearly not given."

- In summary, Tyson was at a major disadvantage in this trial and was convicted in a trial many saw as unjust. His crude behavior and style hurt him in the eyes of the jury, but the prosecution and court were also biased against him, in the view of some observers.

 

- Mike Tyson’s guilty verdict and sentencing was largely due to Garrison’s successful portrayal of Desiree Washington as an innocent victim, despite her questionable background and motives. The jury appeared to focus more on Tyson’s bad reputation than the facts of the case. 

- Some misfortune happened to Garrison during the trial. His wife left him with their new baby for the policeman guarding her.

- Mike Tyson was walking by his apartment building when he ran into his estranged father, who he hadn’t seen in 10 years. Although intimidated at first, Tyson invited his father up and gave him money. Tyson’s father was known as a hustler, gambler and pimp in Brooklyn. Tyson wanted to learn from his father but his father said he couldn’t teach Tyson anything beyond “the Bible and pimping.” His father started to get cocky, revealed inappropriate details about Tyson’s mother, and questioned whether Tyson was really his son. Tyson told him to stop.

- Tyson called Natalie, the mother of his supposed son D’Amato, and sent her $100,000. She then sued him for millions. A paternity test later revealed the child was not Tyson’s. Tyson was crushed but felt Natalie deserved the betrayal for being a “ho.”

- Tyson was sent to the Indiana Youth Center, a medium-security prison. At the time, most inmates were white people convicted of sex and drug crimes. Tyson realized being in jail was a “blessing in disguise” that provided stability.

 

Mike Tyson was angry when he first went to prison, waiting for someone to test him so he could prove how violent he was. However, after some time, he realized he needed to avoid trouble to have a chance to leave sooner. He witnessed horrific violence and inhumane conditions in the prison. He was frequently disciplined for minor infractions and spent time in solitary confinement, which he found oddly liberating in its isolation.  

Public opinion was turning in Tyson’s favor, and some jurors said they believed he didn’t receive a fair trial. His accuser, Desiree Washington, gave media interviews and filed a civil lawsuit against him. Tyson’s appeals for a new trial were denied multiple times. During this time, Tyson’s father died, but he wasn’t allowed to attend the funeral.

In 1993, new evidence emerged questioning Washington’s credibility and innocence. Friends said she was experienced with sex, and a high school friend claimed she had falsely accused him of rape to avoid trouble with her parents. It was also reported that in 1989, Washington’s mother had her father arrested for assaulting Washington.

Tyson witnessed unimaginable violence and inhumane treatment in prison but worked to avoid further trouble. Public support grew for him, but his appeals failed as questionable new details emerged about his accuser’s background and possible past false accusations.

 

- Desiree Washington accused her friend Wayne of raping her in October 1989. But other witnesses contradicted her claim and said she had consensual sex with Wayne.

- Desiree’s father assaulted her when he found out she had lost her virginity. Her mother confirmed this and said Desiree was depressed and suicidal.

- Desiree denied ever having sex with Wayne in an affidavit. But another friend, Marc, said Desiree told him she had sex with Wayne and then cried.

- The appeals court rejected Tyson’s appeal. One judge dissented and said Tyson did not get a fair trial. The Indiana Supreme Court refused to hear the appeal.

- Tyson had a hard first year in prison, threatening his cellmate Earl. But Earl mentored Tyson and taught him how to serve his time without trouble. 

- Tyson got a lot of letters in prison and an inmate named Buck taught him how to get money and gifts from the letters. They made $100,000. But Tyson got worried when people wanted to visit, so he had another inmate handle the letters.

- A woman from England visited and confronted Tyson, demanding the gifts she had sent. Tyson denied knowing her. The prison investigated but dropped it, not wanting trouble. They caught the real inmate involved.

- Tyson had sex in prison with a white inmate's pregnant wife during visits. The inmate said the babies were his.

In summary, there is more evidence that contradicts Desiree's claims against Tyson. In prison, Tyson learned how to serve his time from a mentor and also exploited letters from fans to make money, though this led to some unwanted encounters and investigations. He also managed to have a sexual relationship with another inmate's wife during visitations.

 

The speaker describes engaging in risky sexual behavior and illegal activities while in prison. He has unprotected sex with visitors in the prison yard and trades contraband with other inmates. He becomes close with an inmate named Wayno, who runs an underground store within the prison, selling commissary items and other contraband at a markup. 

The speaker and Wayno develop various money-making schemes. They sell autographs and photos of famous visitors. They sell nude photos and “phone sex” calls with women, customizing the calls for specific inmates by using their names. The speaker also arranges for his friends on the outside to meet women who write to him.

Overall, the speaker adopts an anti-authority mindset in prison. He sees himself as a “martyr” and tries to manipulate the system in any way he can. His time in prison hardens his rebellious attitudes.

 

Mike Tyson and his friend Wayno were thriving in prison. They had connections and were living comfortably, getting deliveries of nice food and anything else they wanted. They ran a prison “store” and lent money to other inmates. 

Mike wanted a bigger room and Wayno tried to negotiate for one diplomatically but Mike lost patience and insulted the administrators, hurting their chances. The administrators soon split Mike and Wayno up, transferring Wayno to a maximum security prison.

Mike started getting sex from a female drug counselor at the prison. He gave her $10,000 to fix her roof and in exchange, she would call him to her office for sex, sometimes several times a day. At first, Mike had trouble performing out of fear of being setup but eventually, they were having frequent, intense sex all over her office. Mike had to stop working out as much to keep up. Wayno eventually returned and acted as a lookout for them.

The counselor ended up getting pregnant. Mike had a friend take her to get an abortion to resolve the situation. The friend was angry at Mike for the mess.

Overall, while Mike and Wayno were living well and Mike was preoccupied with the affair for a time, his behavior caused issues that he had to get fixed and risked causing him greater trouble. The summary shows how Mike’s impulsiveness and risky behavior led to complications even when things were going well.

- Mike Tyson was scheduled to be released from prison in a week after successfully completing a drug rehabilitation program. However, an investigator came to interview him regarding allegations that he had been spending an inordinate amount of time alone with his drug counselor.

- After being released from prison, the narrator trained for a comeback fight against Peter McNeeley. His team, including Rory, John, and Anthony, helped manage his affairs. They used walkie-talkies to communicate but the narrator didn’t always like being easily reachable. He sometimes snuck out of camp to eat junk food or see women.

- Sparring with an amateur boxer hurt the narrator’s confidence for the McNeeley fight, but he ended up winning easily. McNeeley’s corner threw in the towel early, angering the crowd. McNeeley ended up profiting from commercial deals parodying the fight.

- The narrator’s next fight against Buster Mathis Jr. was postponed after the narrator broke his thumb. The media criticized him for it.

The summary covers the key details around the narrator acquiring and caring for tiger cubs, training for his comeback fight against McNeeley, the anticlimactic end to that fight, and the postponement of the next fight against Mathis.

 

- Tyson had a habit of postponing fights to mentally unsettle his opponents. He would make them think he was training hard, but actually wasn’t. Then he would train hard right before the fight when they had already peaked. 
- There was a lot of pressure on Tyson to regain the heavyweight title. He had to take big fights to honor his contracts and make money. 
- Tyson fought Buster Mathis Jr. in December 1995. Mathis came in overweight. Tyson dominated and won by KO in the 3rd round. After the fight, Tyson’s girlfriend Kenya trashed their hotel suite.

- Tyson’s trainer Crocodile caused problems during training by provoking Tyson’s sparring partners and telling Tyson they were disrespecting him. This led to dangerous sparring situations. 
- Tyson fought Frank Bruno in March 1996. Bruno’s fans were against Tyson. Tyson could tell Bruno was scared, which boosted his confidence. Tyson dominated and won by TKO in the 3rd round to regain the WBC heavyweight title. 
- After the fight, Tyson paid respect to Bruno and Allah. He knew Bruno hadn’t fought his best, or else Tyson wouldn’t have won. Tyson had a big party to celebrate, drinking 100 bottles of champagne. 
- A week later, Tyson said he deserved more than $30 million for his next fight and needed to support his children.

 

- After Mike Tyson regained the heavyweight championship title, he became a target for many scamsters and con artists trying to take advantage of his fame and money. 

- His management team had to pay out a lot of money to ward off various fraudulent lawsuits and claims against Tyson. Many people would pretend to get hurt or involved in some incident with Tyson just to try and get money from him.

- One example was a woman in Chicago who claimed Tyson assaulted her in a nightclub. Even though nothing actually happened, she demanded $10 million from Tyson and called the press to publicly accuse him after Tyson's team refused. 

- Tyson's friend Leonard helped clear up the situation. He found out the woman's claims were untrue and had other witnesses confirm Tyson did nothing wrong. But the woman still sued the nightclub and got money from their insurance company.

- Even Tyson's probation officer tried to take advantage of the situation to extort money from Tyson. He sent Tyson's team a bill for $7 million, claiming it was a "behavioral modification charge" for Tyson's "poor judgement" in the Chicago incident. He eventually lowered the demand to $2 million. Tyson's team never paid him and fired him once Tyson's probation ended.

- After regaining his title, Tyson's ego and sense of grandiosity grew. He started throwing lavish parties and living an extravagant lifestyle again.

- The author reserved 19 bedrooms in his house for women he wanted to sleep with, moving his girlfriend Hope to a hotel. He invited women he considered unattractive, angering Hope. He did not invite his ex Monica. The author admits he was not marriage material at the time.

- The author's next fight was against Bruce Seldon for the WBA belt. The author did not train much and mocked Seldon at the pre-fight press conference. The author won in less than 2 minutes, though he did not think the punches that knocked Seldon out were that hard. Seldon's trainer said Seldon had a nervous breakdown from fear.

- The author's friend Tupac came to see him after the fight. Tupac represented the harsh realities of black life that many tried to hide. The author made plans to see Tupac later but fell asleep. Tupac was then shot and killed, which seemed like an assassination to the author. The author said Tupac had a big heart but was also a warrior.

- Though now very wealthy, the author was still depressed. He started using marijuana and cocaine again after 15 years of being clean. He knew this went against his Muslim faith but felt overwhelmed.

- Due to a lawsuit, the author had to give up the WBC belt. His next fight was against Evander Holyfield for the WBA belt. The author would have won easily if they fought in 1991, but after prison he lost timing and skill. His promoter pushed him into the fight, and the author wanted the money. Holyfield had looked bad in recent fights, so the author did not train much.

- The author and Holyfield went back to the Junior Olympics. The author was not mentally into boxing anymore, needing motivation from his trainer to fight. 

- In the first fight, the author started well but then "blacked out" from head butts from Holyfield, fighting on instinct. The author could not hear his corner and did not remember much. After the fight, his trainer showed him 6 fist-sized knots on his head from the head butts. The author wanted to fight Holyfield again immediately, angry and sore from the loss.

 

- Mike Tyson was angry after losing his first fight against Evander Holyfield but started training hard for the rematch right away. He did not dwell on losses and moved on quickly. 
- Losing can be traumatic for some boxers. Floyd Patterson and George Foreman struggled after losses and described the feeling as like being dead. But Tyson was taught by Cus D’Amato not to take wins or losses personally. Boxing was just a job, not his whole life. 
- Before the rematch, Tyson’s personal life was chaotic. His girlfriend Monica was pregnant with their second child but Tyson rarely saw her or his kids. He proposed to her but continued to see other women. His daughter Hope urged him to get a prenuptial agreement but he did not.
- Tyson trained hard for the rematch and was confident going in, vowing to knock Holyfield out again. But there was controversy over the referee, as the referee from the first fight was drunk and lenient. The replacement, Mills Lane, was biased against Tyson. 
- In the fight, Holyfield continuously head-butted Tyson, causing a bad cut. Tyson complained to Lane but no penalties were called. Frustrated, Tyson bit Holyfield's ear. Lane took points from Tyson but more head-butts followed. Tyson bit the other ear.
- The fight was stopped and Tyson disqualified. Chaos ensued, as Tyson tried to go after Holyfield's cornermen. Tyson had to be restrained and fought the police. Objects were thrown at Tyson on his way out.
- Lane and Holyfield claimed the head-butts were accidental. Tyson's camp argued the head-butts were intentional and the bites were a reaction. Tyson was still enraged after the fight and had to be contained. His face was badly swollen in the post-fight interview.

 

- Mike Tyson bit Evander Holyfield's ear in the second round of their heavyweight title rematch. Tyson was angry because Holyfield had been headbutting him, opening a cut above Tyson's eye.

- Tyson complained to the referee, Mills Lane, about the headbutts but Lane did nothing. Frustrated, Tyson bit Holyfield's ear in retaliation. Lane then stopped the fight. 

- Tyson felt regretful after the fight but also felt that things were stacked against him. Many fans actually supported Tyson's actions. Tyson had to issue a public apology and was fined $3 million and suspended for at least a year by the Nevada State Athletic Commission.

- Tyson felt the punishment was unfair compared to other incidents of violence in sports that received little to no punishment. For example, a hockey player once broke an opponent's ankle with his stick and received no fine or suspension. Tyson felt betrayed by the commission after all the money he had brought to Las Vegas.

- Tyson acknowledged that biting Holyfield was "an awful thing to do" but said Holyfield knew that feeling of retaliation after Holyfield had once dropped an opponent in his youth and then stomped on him after he went down.

 

- Evander Holyfield bit Mike Tyson's shoulder during their fight, drawing blood. Holyfield only faced minor consequences while Tyson's reputation suffered.

- During his suspension from boxing, Tyson spent a lot of time at strip clubs and was not often seen in public. He was living an indulgent lifestyle and spending money excessively. 

- Tyson was found not liable in Mitch Green's lawsuit and only had to pay $45,000. However, Tyson was low on money at this point due to overspending and owed $10 million in taxes. He gave the remaining $6 million he had to his children instead of paying the taxes.

- Tyson got into a serious motorcycle accident because he fell asleep while driving. He suffered broken ribs, a broken shoulder, and a punctured lung. He refused medical help at first but eventually went to the hospital.

- Tyson hired a woman named Shawnee Simms to help improve his image and bring in new business opportunities. His friends warned him she seemed dishonest, but Tyson gave her a chance. They ended up sleeping together once while Tyson was inebriated. 

- Tyson signed a deal to appear at WrestleMania for $3.5 million. However, he was unhappy with the deal Don King had made regarding the use of Tyson's likeness. Tyson sought help from Jeff Wald, an entertainment industry friend.

- Wald was outraged at how Tyson was being taken advantage of financially. King flew out to Los Angeles to meet with them, but Tyson assaulted him. At a subsequent meeting, King offered Wald and his partner 20% of Tyson's earnings to drop the issue, but they refused. Tyson then grabbed a fork and stabbed King in the head with it.

 

- Mike Tyson's friend Jeff Wald tried to break up a physical altercation between Tyson and Don King at Tyson's house. Jeff screamed at them to stop, his secretary ran out of the house in fear, and Don King left. 

- Tyson then hired Jeff Wald, Irving Azoff, and attorney John Branca to take over his business affairs. They fired Tyson's previous managers, John Horne and Rory Holloway. Though Tyson still cared about Holloway, he had to fire him too because of his association with King and Horne.

- King then began publicly criticizing Jeff Wald in the media. In response, Wald hired a bodyguard for when he traveled to New York. 

- Tyson says he was suffering from depression at the time but was on medication and seeing a psychiatrist, Dr. Goldberg, who diagnosed him with dysthymic disorder. The medication and therapy helped Tyson stay calmer during stressful events.

- One stressful event was an altercation at a late-night diner with two women who harassed and provoked Tyson. Though Tyson verbally responded in anger, the situation did not become physical. However, the women later filed a multi-million dollar lawsuit against Tyson claiming assault, battery, and emotional distress, despite a lack of evidence. Tyson's team eventually settled the suit for much less money.

- By February, Tyson had officially hired Jeff Wald, Irving Azoff, and Shelly Finkel as his new managers and advisors. They replaced King, who had been taking an enormous cut of Tyson's purses and income, often without Tyson's knowledge. 

- In March, Tyson sued King for at least $100 million in stolen money and damages. Tyson's attorney, John Branca, wrote Tyson a memo expressing support in the lawsuit.

 

• Tyson hired new advisors – entertainment lawyer John Branca and Jeff Wald, a former boxing promoter – to take over his career and fight the corrupt influence of Don King. They aimed to win back millions that King and others had cheated Tyson out of over the years. 

• Tyson’s new team formulated a strategy to increase his income through various business deals and sponsorships outside the ring, including a clothing line, record label, autobiography, etc. Meanwhile, Tyson sued Don King’s associates, John Horne and Rory Holloway, for $100 million for the bad deals they encouraged him to sign.

• Though Tyson now had professional advisors, three women – Shawnee, Jackie Rowe, and Monica – remained very involved in managing his daily affairs. Tyson’s ex-wife Monica just wanted to protect him, while Shawnee and Jackie were aggressive in advocating for Tyson’s interests. 

• To generate income, Tyson sold many of his luxury vehicles, raising $3.3 million. He also renegotiated his deal with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) to earn $6 million and a percentage of pay-per-view profits to appear at WrestleMania. Tyson enjoyed promoting the event and interacting with the wrestlers. 

• Tyson continued to face various lawsuits, including from women he harassed, former business associates, and ex-employees like his tiger trainer and former trainer Kevin Rooney. Tyson had some success defending himself in court but also lost $4.4 million in a judgment to Rooney.

• Tyson and his team worked to reinstate his boxing license, which had been revoked for biting Evander Holyfield’s ear. Dr. Elias Ghanem, the head of the Nevada boxing commission, assured them Tyson would be able to get relicensed, believing his punishment had been too harsh.

• In summary, Tyson was trying to take control of his career again after years under Don King’s influence. Though it was a long process, he made some progress reestablishing his independence and setting the stage for his return to boxing.

 Here’s a summary:

- Tyson wanted to get his boxing license back after biting Holyfield’s ear. 
- His advisors thought New Jersey would grant him a license. Tyson appeared before the NJ Athletic Control Board hearing. Despite some objections, things were going well at first. But then Tyson got angry at the assistant AG questioning him and cursed at him.
- Though they were optimistic at first, Tyson’s advisors withdrew his NJ license application the night before the decision to avoid controversy. 
- Tyson got into a road rage incident and assaulted two men. He was charged with misdemeanor assault. This worried his advisors since he was still on probation in Indiana.

- Tyson was doing community service in Phoenix under Sheriff Joe Arpaio. Arpaio’s probation officers were closely monitoring Tyson and wrote him up for any rumor of misconduct. Tyson’s lawyers had to provide witnesses and evidence to dispute the write-ups. Tyson enjoyed the attention and liked being treated like a dangerous criminal.

- One of Arpaio’s sheriffs falsely accused Tyson of assaulting her. Video evidence disproved her claim, but Tyson said he could have gone back to jail in Maryland over the false accusation.

- The narrator attended a boxing match in Manchester, England where he easily defeated his opponent, Francis Botha. After the fight, he hooked up with a Russian woman he had met earlier. She was dating a Chinese arms dealer but decided to see the narrator. The narrator was worried the arms dealer would come after him, but the woman smoothed things over with her boyfriend. 

- In May, the narrator went to a strip club in Las Vegas called Cheetahs. A stripper persistently tried to give him a lap dance, even after he refused. She fell and later claimed the narrator assaulted her. She filed a police report but the police found no evidence to support her claims. She then sued the narrator. During a deposition, the narrator called the stripper and her lawyer names. The case went to arbitration where the stripper was awarded a small amount of money. The whole ordeal ended up costing the narrator a lot in legal fees.

- The narrator was in Phoenix training for an upcoming fight. He was in a bad mood and yelled at his probation officer over the phone. His lawyer, Darrow Soll, smoothed things over to prevent problems with the narrator's probation. The narrator's promoters were worried the Cheetah's lawsuit might prevent him from fighting in England, but Soll was able to resolve issues with the probation officer.

- One of the narrator's close friends, Darryl Baum, was murdered around this time. The narrator had to return to New York because of this.

He went to jail for six years and when he got out, the narrator offered him money and a job to help him straighten out his life. But Shorty Love refused and got involved in a gang dispute where he was shot and killed six months after getting out of jail. The narrator paid for his lavish funeral. 

Before a fight in Scotland, the narrator was doing cocaine and smoking marijuana. He had to use a fake penis called a “whizzer” to pass his drug test.

His parole officer and psychiatrist were concerned about his behavior.

Back in Las Vegas, the narrator started walking 30 miles a day, often while high and drunk. The long walks, heat, drugs and alcohol caused erratic behavior and paranoia. His security team followed him on these long walks and had to keep track of him. One time, while high, the narrator got paranoid that his security was spying on him. He walked to a police station to complain about them, temporarily slipping his mind that he was paying them to follow him.

In summary, the narrator describes his erratic and self-destructive behavior around the time of a fight in Scotland, including heavy drug use, excessive walking while intoxicated and paranoid behavior towards his own security team. His friend Shorty Love's tragic death also contributed to his poor state of mind during this time.

- In June 2001, the narrator's ex-wife Camille died. The narrator fell into a deeper depression and did more drugs. He had to start training for a fight in Denmark. During training, the narrator had a brief sexual encounter with a 50-year-old woman he met at Kmart.

 

- Mike Tyson went to the emergency room with his friend Rick because a woman he knew from Kmart wanted to be examined. 

- The woman told Rick that she and Mike had sex the night before, even though Mike told her he couldn't because he was training. She said Mike had hurt her during sex. She asked Rick how Mike felt about her now that they'd had sex.

Around the same time, while high on cocaine, Tyson got into a fight with two men outside his hotel in New York and ended up in court. Tyson’s friends pointed out that Tyson actually had a worse criminal record than the two men. 

By this time, Tyson was tired of the drama surrounding him and fired his whole management team. His only source of income was a lawsuit against Don King. Tyson’s lawyers told him he could settle the suit for up to $60 million. However, Tyson’s financial situation was dire and his friends were telling him to declare bankruptcy. Tyson ended up filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in August 2002, owing $27 million in debts.

The bankruptcy filing revealed details of Tyson’s lavish spending and debts to the public. Tyson gave up fighting and stayed in Phoenix for a while, living on little money with his friend Dave Malone. To earn money, Tyson occasionally set up paid autograph signings.

Some friends helped Tyson out financially. Eric Brown and his brother gave Tyson a $50,000 advance. Tyson’s friend Craig Boogie set up a promotional deal with K-1, a mixed martial arts organization.

That covers the key highlights from that part of Tyson’s book regarding his cocaine use and partying. Let me know if you would like me to explain anything in the summary in more detail.

 

Mike Tyson was partying extensively in Phoenix during this time. He purchased a house there where he hosted wild parties with wealthy friends, doctors, and celebrities. At one party, Tyson and his friend Crocodile brought a porn star back to Tyson’s house but were too high to have sex with her. 

Tyson started getting morphine drips from a plastic surgeon friend to deal with his cocaine comedowns. He began hallucinating from all the drugs and alcohol. The FBI questioned Tyson about a photograph of him with a serial killer named Dale Hausner, but Tyson had just briefly met the man during an interview. 

Tyson got a job doing boxing exhibitions at the Aladdin Hotel in Las Vegas. He invited many friends to stay with him there for free, ordering them whatever they wanted at the hotel's expense. Bobby Brown and his girlfriend Karrine Steffans visited Tyson. While Tyson wanted to hang out with Brown, Brown was more serious about Steffans than Tyson realized. 

Tyson had increasing trouble buying cocaine during this time because dealers didn't want to contribute to his downward spiral and addiction. Even when Tyson did buy drugs, dealers would sometimes take them back without payment, telling Tyson he needed to focus on training instead. Tyson began threatening and stealing from the few dealers who would still sell to him when he had little money.

 

- The author describes struggling with a cocaine addiction and relying on wealthy acquaintances and strip clubs to supply him with drugs. His addiction caused him to mistreat women, become estranged from friends and family, and neglect his health and responsibilities. 

- An old acquaintance saw him in a vulnerable state and expressed concern for his wellbeing. The author's therapist challenged him to complete a six-week rehab program. To prove he could do it, the author stopped using drugs for six weeks while on a work trip in England. The withdrawals were difficult, but he succeeded.

- When the author entered rehab, the program immediately medicated him and asked him probing questions about his addiction and childhood. The questions upset him, and he left the program after one day, cursing at the staff. 

- A week later, the author's therapist insisted he try rehab again. He entered a different program in Tucson.

- The summary highlights the author's struggle with overcoming an addiction that caused harm to himself and others, but with the support of his therapist, he kept trying to get help. The initial failure at the first rehab program shows the difficulty of facing one's demons, but his persistence at trying again is a hopeful sign.

 

- Mike Tyson went to rehab in Phoenix, Arizona but faced racism and judgment from the staff there. He felt like the "token Negro." 

- On Christmas Eve 2006, Tyson went to a strip club and bought cocaine. He then drove while high and was pulled over by police, who found more cocaine on him. He was arrested.

- Tyson's lawyer got him into another rehab program in Phoenix right away to show the court he was serious about getting help. But Tyson did not like the director there and was kicked out.

- Tyson's lawyer and friend Marilyn then found him a rehab place in Los Angeles called Wonderland. This rehab was high-end and catered to wealthy clients. Tyson liked it much better there.

- Though Tyson had to start rehab over again, Wonderland gave him his own room and the other clients were more accepting of him. He started attending A.A. meetings and was able to go into town on his own, with a curfew.

- Tyson seemed to be doing well at Wonderland until an issue came up partway through his stay there.

 Here’s a summary:

- The narrator, named Mike, was admitted to a rehab facility called Wonderland despite concerns over his criminal history. He had struggled with cocaine addiction and alcoholism for years. 

- Initially, Mike was tempted by offers to go out at night with other patients and celebrities, but he resisted, committed to his recovery. He threw himself into the 12-step program, attending multiple meetings a day and doing service work. He found support from fellow addicts in recovery, including rock stars and actors.

- Being at Wonderland and committing to sobriety gave Mike his life back and a daily rhythm of working out, attending meetings, and having meals with others.

- Mike Tyson struggled with sex addiction for much of his life. He would have multiple sexual partners and one-night stands, and moved from woman to woman quickly. 

- He started seeing a sex counselor and sex addicts group to address this issue. He realized that his constant need for sex and validation from women was unhealthy and left him feeling empty. 

- Tyson's issues with sex stemmed from his troubled childhood and desire for love and intimacy that he never received from his mother. He was using sex as a way to fill this void, but it only made him feel worse in the end.

- Tyson made inappropriate comments about women at times, showing his unhealthy views. For example, when receiving an honorary doctorate, he made a crude joke about becoming a gynecologist. He later realized how inappropriate this was.

- Tyson came to understand that he was "in love with love, not the actual individual." The pressure to satisfy many sexual partners left him feeling hollow and worthless. 

- Although Tyson was used to group sex and orgies at times, he eventually realized that "sex is a very complex situation" and that "everybody doesn't fit with everybody else." He learned that he was using sex to find intimacy and love that he craved.

- Tyson compares himself to "a whore just like my mother" who was seeking validation and worth through sex and relationships with many people. But unlike his mother, "this whore had the money" to lavish gifts on people.

- Ultimately, Tyson's struggles with sex and women seemed to stem from a lack of love and affection from his mother during childhood. His unhealthy views of sex and relationships were deeply ingrained from his experiences growing up.

- Though committed to recovery, he started dating a woman named Paula shortly after beginning a program. She had been sober for 18 years and helped keep him accountable, though dating went against the rules. 

- He participated in filming a documentary during rehab, in part for money. Though sober, his behavior in it still seemed like an “addict character.”

After receiving a devastating phone call that his four-year-old daughter Exodus had accidentally died, he realized he needed to change. He flew to Phoenix where Exodus was on life support. She was soon taken off life support and passed away. The narrator was overwhelmed with grief, anger, and questions about her death. 

Exodus's funeral was a huge outpouring of support that showed the narrator how much people cared about him. He realized he wanted to live a more responsible, meaningful life to honor his daughter's memory. He committed to working the 12 Steps, being loyal to Kiki, and being a better father.

However, a week after the funeral the pain became too much and the narrator relapsed into doing cocaine. Kiki begged him to at least stay home if he had to use so that he would be safe. The next morning, Kiki went to meet her probation officer and tested positive for cocaine. The probation officer threatened to remove Kiki's baby into foster care.

 Here’s a summary:

- Mike Tyson was unable to drive himself to a party due to a suspended license. He had a celebrity encounter with some police officers who agreed to escort him there. However, their presence caused most of the partygoers to leave shortly after arriving. 

- Tyson continued using cocaine and eventually checked into a no-frills rehabilitation center called Impact at the urging of his wife Kiki. However, he left within a day due to the conditions and clientele. Even so, this short stay helped him decide to get sober.

- The success of The Hangover movie and encouragement from directors/actors motivated Tyson to get clean and pursue more acting roles. He went on an extreme diet, losing over 100 pounds to get in better shape for movie roles. 

- Tyson appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show in October to promote his documentary. During the interview, he acknowledged that his apology to Evander Holyfield for biting his ear was insincere. After the show aired, Oprah received many positive responses and Evander asked her to arrange for them to reconcile on her show.

- Tyson's life seemed to be turning around thanks to his sobriety, diet, and new focus on acting. With Oprah's help, he was going to make amends with Evander Holyfield.

 Here's a summary of the passage:

- The speaker saw Evander Holyfield and apologized to him publicly. They wanted to set an example for kids to stop violence.

- The speaker stayed on a vegan diet and lost weight. But he slipped up and did cocaine again in January 2010. His wife was upset but gave him another chance.

- The speaker went to Europe and Italy to make appearances and money. His wife didn't like his dance partner in Italy. They got in fights in Kazakhstan and his wife flew home.

- The speaker then went to Mecca for a religious pilgrimage. He explained his complex religious background, being baptized Catholic and his skepticism of preachers. He eventually embraced Islam in jail, though he used to mock Muslims. He learned Islam is about humanity, not hostility.

- Overall, the passage describes the speaker making amends, struggling with sobriety, marital issues, and his journey to faith in Islam.

 

- The speaker believes Islam is about love, peace and submission to God. Submitting to God does not make you weak but humble. Islam teaches an individual relationship with God and that we are judged based on our own actions, not those of others. 

- The speaker celebrates some Christian holidays with his kids even though he is Muslim. He believes all religions spread the same message of love. He does not want to go to heaven if it only has Muslims and does not have his non-Muslim friends and loved ones. He thinks heaven should have a mix of people from different faiths.

- The speaker finds the concept of God incomprehensible. He does not believe humans can understand God or be on his level. He questions whether God has negative human traits like humans do. He sometimes feels life may be an illusion. While he tries to be spiritual, he is skeptical of organized religion and spiritual leaders. 

- Going on the hajj to Mecca and Medina strengthened the speaker’s faith but he also saw political agendas and a desire to use his fame for publicity.

He felt bad receiving special treatment to kiss the black stone at the Kaaba.

- The speaker’s wife Kiki is Christian at heart but practices Islam. He went to China as a boxing ambassador and filmed The Hangover Part II in Thailand. He enjoyed the experience, staying sober and appreciating the opportunity. He returned home to be with his pregnant wife Kiki.

He values love, faith and humility but questions strict or superficial expressions of religion. His experiences on the hajj and filming The Hangover sequel show his personal growth and maturation in sobriety and faith. Overall it depicts his philosophical thinking on profound topics.

 

- Mike Tyson and his wife Kiki were expecting a baby in January 2012. Kiki went into early labor at 27 weeks and was put on bed rest. Mike attended all her medical appointments and was very supportive. Their son, Morocco, was born on January 25th. 

- That same year, Mike Tyson was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame. He was surprised he was inducted given his bad reputation in boxing.

At the ceremony, Mike thought of his old trainer Cus D’Amato who had believed in him. 

- Mike reflects on what makes an exciting fighter - the desire to hurt the opponent.

By early 2012, they had put together Mike’s one-man show.

- After the show closed, Tyson traveled to the UK and Poland for business. While in Poland, Spike Lee's production company contacted him about bringing the show to Broadway. They ended up producing a darker, grittier version of the show for Broadway in August. They then toured the country with that show in 2013.

- Performing on stage makes Tyson anxious but he loves entertaining people. He says he got his storytelling ability from Cus D'Amato. Talking about his daughter Exodus during the show is emotionally difficult for him. 

- In early 2013, Tyson had guest roles on Law & Order: SVU and How I Met Your Mother. Some protested his role on SVU but the show's creator and others supported Tyson. Tyson says he loves acting even if he's not sure he's good at it.

- The national tour of Tyson's one-man show began in February 2013, opening in Indianapolis. Visiting the prison there was emotional for Tyson. After the tour, he realized that he is meant to entertain people, even if just a few, because he loves performing. 

- Tyson reflects that he can never again have the fame and fortune he once did as a boxer. But he's reinventing himself and is grateful he doesn't have to live that flashy lifestyle anymore. He's doing more intimate shows now, which he feels may be more suitable for him. He says he mostly just wanted glory and fame when he was younger, which is why he lost all his money.

 

- The narrator initially sought glory and honor but realized over time that honor cannot be earned, only lost. He had an epiphany that everything he knew was wrong and he had to change.

He questions how he was able to act that way, especially when he was famous. He dealt with many problems from his promiscuous lifestyle.

- The narrator has led an extraordinary life, with both good and bad. He no longer harbors ill will toward those who have wronged him, like Don King. The narrator is writing a book to tell the truth. He has more work to do to love himself truly. Therapy has helped him change. 

- The narrator and his wife started a charity to help disadvantaged children. He wants to focus on children's mental health, knowing how he suffered being misdiagnosed and overmedicated as a child. Many in prison need mental health help, not incarceration.

- The narrator regrets his promiscuous past and is now committed to his wife. He has broken the cycle of dysfunction he learned from his mother's relationships. His wife saved him and helped him become responsible. He sees her as an equal partner. Staying busy and living a purposeful life keeps him from relapsing into addiction. 

- Family gives the narrator a sense of permanence and safety. He is committed to them like he once was to boxing. He knows he can easily bring them trouble, so he works to stay sober and responsible. Life is short, so he lives each day fully with gratitude. He takes responsibility for himself rather than blaming others. He knows he is his own worst enemy.

- The narrator collects and breeds roller pigeons, comparing them to his own tendency to rise high and fall fast. He finds comfort in these birds, as he always has.

 

The author describes struggling with depression, anger issues, and low self-esteem despite having a loving family. He feels like he wasted his life and hasn’t achieved as much as he had hoped. He has trouble sleeping and controlling his emotions. He attributes this in part to long-term drug use. 

He comes from a poor, rough background and still feels most comfortable in rough neighborhoods around rough people, even though he now lives a more middle-class lifestyle. He is proud of overcoming his difficult upbringing but his children will never truly understand it.

He questions why he is married and faithful instead of living the promiscuous lifestyle of his youth. He wonders if he has lost his “balls” and vitality. He sees himself as insecure in relationships and either too passive or too aggressive, with no in between. He never learned how to have normal, healthy relationships and his baseline is dysfunctional and crude. 

He thinks he is a “bad catch” as a partner - ignorant, self-centered, and difficult to live with. He questions why anyone would want to be with him. Part of the reason he got married was to avoid being taken advantage of by women. He feels he deserves rewards and recognition for becoming a better person, even though he will never truly escape his troubled past and tendencies.

In summary, the author seems to be grappling with his sense of identity as he ages and struggles to reconcile his rough origins and history with his present reality. He desires to be a good partner and family man but feels ill-equipped due to his background and mental health issues.

 

- The author sees the world as a constant struggle for survival while his wife sees the positive and beauty in the world. She wants everyone to be happy while the author believes you can't make everyone happy. He sees the evil in people that his wife doesn't. 

- The author is worried about becoming famous again because he worries he can't handle it and will become violent. His wife reassures him he can handle it now but he doesn't like being a target. He is overprotective of his wife because she and his family are all he has now. When he feels scared, his violent side comes out.

- The author is now an entertainer entering show business. He hopes to find success to provide for his family but worries he will be taken advantage of, triggering his violent tendencies again and landing him in jail as his wife moves on. He questions if he was even meant for life and hates himself. His daughter lifts his spirits.

- The author's older children had an easy, privileged life unlike his own difficult upbringing. He has no parenting skills but is doing his best. His own father would have treated his daughters much worse. The author is still dealing with the traumatized 15-year-old boy inside him but now has the tools to do so. 

- The author mostly stays home to avoid trouble and getting involved with the wrong people. Going out used to feel good but often led to legal and financial troubles. He stays in out of fear of his own reactions and quick anger that was instilled in him from a young age. His sleep schedule is unusual, staying up late and waking up early to work out. 

- When his wife and children leave the house, the author worries they won't come back. He never thinks of doing anything wrong now and just wants to care for his family and help others. His life experiences have made him very cautious. He is always telling his wife to lock doors and be safe. His family is all that matters now.

 

- The speaker is very protective and possessive of his wife and family. He is constantly worried about threats and danger. He has had traumatic experiences in the past where violence erupted suddenly, so he is hypervigilant. 

- His wife thinks he is paranoid and “absolutely insane.” His behavior and worries are abnormal and extreme. His “borderline normal” in the past involved being around dangerous people and situations. 

- He ruminates a lot when alone, thinking about his strange childhood, his path to becoming heavyweight champion despite the odds, his old trainer Cus D’Amato who believed in him, and his own troubled persona of “Mike Tyson.” He doesn’t fully understand how he became who he is.

- Although he is mostly a homebody now, he does occasionally go out to public events, like boxing matches, concerts, and comedy shows. However, being in public places around strangers and fans causes anxiety because of the possibility of unwanted interactions and chaos. He feels the need to protect his wife in these situations.

- He expresses deep love and admiration for his wife, Kiki, who has stuck by him through immense difficulties and ups and downs. He is amazed at her patience and commitment to him, given how much of a “difficult person” he is. He believes she has made him a better, more loyal man, though it has been an immense challenge. He feels very fortunate to have her in his life.

- Overall, the speaker comes across as a troubled but self-aware man who is trying to find peace and stability after a tumultuous life. His wife and family are his sanctuary and salvation. Though still battling “demons,” he seems to have come a long way to overcoming his past.

 

The speaker does not feel he deserves his wife. He feels like a “bum” compared to her. He says love is something we cannot control or command. It can lead us to both positive and negative behaviors and outcomes. The speaker expresses his love for his wife in many ways, both good and bad. Love requires sacrificing control, even though we may not fully understand what we are sacrificing for. 

The speaker finds connections with historical figures through reading old love letters. He relates to Napoleon’s obsessive love for Josephine, even though she did not reciprocate his strong feelings. He also shares a tragic love letter from the German writer Heinrich von Kleist to Henriette Vogel, with whom he committed suicide. The speaker says reading these letters makes him and his wife emotional.

Originally, the speaker intended to end the book on this emotional and inspirational note. However, he felt he had to be honest about relapsing in the past few months after being sober since 2010. He sees himself as a “vicious addict” who will die if he does not follow the 12 steps of Alcoholics Anonymous. Part of making amends was apologizing to his old trainer Teddy Atlas, with whom he had not spoken in 20 years. While promoting his first boxing event, making amends to Atlas overwhelmed him with guilt and shame over his recent relapses. He confessed this during the post-fight press conference, saying that he struggles with self-hatred and a dark internal voice that “wants to kill everything.” But making amends to Atlas made him proud of himself, which he says does not happen often.

The summary outlines the speaker’s complex views on love, his personal struggles with addiction and self-image, and his efforts to overcome these struggles through making amends and being publicly honest about his setbacks.

 

The speaker expresses remorse for his actions and wants to make amends. He says he has been sober for six days, which is a miracle for him, and he wants to continue on this path. He realizes that he needs the help and support of others to overcome his addiction and become a better person. 

The speaker discusses his use of the terms “nigga” and “smuck.” He says “nigga” can be used positively or negatively, depending on the context, and is not limited to black people. However, “nigga shit” is always negative. He coined the term “smuck” to mean someone contemptible who is not even worthy of being called a “schmuck.”

The speaker thanks many people who have helped and supported him, including:

- Cus D’Amato, his mentor, who helped him achieve great success. 

- Larry “Ratso” Sloman, his collaborator, for his patience in helping to write the book. 

- His lawyers and agents for their work in support of the book.
