 Here is a summary of the key ideas:

Copyright 2018 by Deepak Chopra and Rudolph E. Tanzi. Published by Harmony Books.

There are many threats to human health today, including globalization, travel, population growth, and viruses/bacteria. However, we can strengthen our immunity through lifelong wellness and healthy habits.

Key ideas: 

1) Globalization and population growth challenge our immunity. Disease threats are overwhelming our defenses.

2) Viruses and bacteria are mutating faster, accelerating challenges to human immunity. 

3) Medicine alone can't solve all health issues or keep up with mutations. Lifelong wellness and healthy lifestyles are critical. Starting self-care early builds resilience.

The main message is that while threats exist, resilience comes from lifelong wellness and self-care. Holistic, continuous wellness is key.

• Microscopic threats like bacteria and viruses constantly challenge health and immunity. Despite progress, diseases persist and spread. Aging increases vulnerability.

• Overreliance on drugs has caused issues like opioid addiction. We need an expanded, holistic view of health encompassing diet, exercise, sleep, stress, etc. Chronic inflammation undermines immunity.

• The "healing self" integrates the role of both healer and healed. Individuals must take proactive health steps. Reliance on external measures alone is insufficient.  

• Benefits of the healing self include balance, lifestyle-based disease prevention, reduced drug dependence, successful aging, and longer healthspans. Awareness and knowledge empower health choices.

• There are two types of immunity: passive (inherited) and active (acquired). Active immunity is complex but can make mistakes. Boosting active immunity has long been possible (e.g. vaccination). Lifestyle significantly impacts active immunity.

• Simple things like music, pets, and experiences impact health, aging, and Alzheimer's. Health depends on both body and mind. Medicine has been slow to recognize mind/experience's role. Health is holistic. Perception and environment powerfully impact well-being.  

We're often confused on how to stay healthy and rely on luck. The medical model also relies on statistics and risks, viewing health as unpredictable. Treatments don't always work and doctors don't always know causes or cures. At some point, medical care stops working for most.

Reasons medical care stops working: 1) Unknown cause of illness. 2) No effective treatments. 3) Treatments too risky/toxic/expensive. 4) Treatment side effects outweigh benefits. 5) Condition too advanced to treat. 6) Patient too old for treatment. 7) Medical error.  

When medical care stops working, health control is lost. We need an alternative to the "gambling" health model. The "healing self" model provides it, focusing on lifelong wellness. Rather than relying on luck and risks, people work to become and stay healthy long-term. The healing self steers the body and mind toward health and wholeness. 

In summary, we must reject that health is primarily due to chance or luck. Developing our healing selves provides more control and helps us become/stay healthy for life. Medical care has limits, so we must look beyond it to thrive.

The healing self model sees disruptions, healing responses, and outcomes holistically. Disruptions threaten health. Healing responses restore balance. Outcomes are return to health.

Our bodies haven't evolved quickly enough for modern disruptions like unhealthy diets. We must make conscious choices supporting innate healing ability. Food choice awareness helps avoid unhealthy choices and support health.

The healing self approach provides benefits like patience, vigilance, and health history knowledge that even good doctors may lack time for. You can provide these through self-care and partnering with your doctor.

This book doesn't provide cures for chronic/incurable illnesses. It empowers you to stay well by optimizing your body's healing potential through awareness and healthy choices. For symptoms/illnesses, medical care is still required.

Quizzes provide a health/body relationship baseline for developing your healing self.

The key to health is mastering processes like sleep, diet, and stress management. Those who stay well intuitively let their body's healing abilities work. 

The body operates as a dual control system. It automatically regulates critical functions to keep us alive, but we can consciously intervene and alter these functions. Our daily choices either support health or undermine it at a cellular level.

There are two kinds of healing:

1. Automatic healing: The innate abilities we inherit through evolution.

2. Conscious healing: The choices we make each day to support and improve our automatic healing. 

Virtually every life experience impacts our health, positively or negatively. Feeling depressed/anxious, stuck in unhealthy habits, lack of purpose, social isolation, etc. challenge our health. We can consciously evolve our health choices to support automatic healing. This is key to wellness.

 

- Angioplasty quickly relieves symptoms but does not treat the underlying disease or significantly increase life expectancy. It has risks like repeat blockages and is expensive.

- Heart bypass surgery is more invasive and risky but also does not substantially increase life expectancy for most patients or reverse plaque buildup.

- Lifestyle changes are the only proven way to reverse heart disease by addressing both mind and body. Emotional and psychological factors strongly influence heart health. 

- Heart disease has many complex, interrelated causes including lifestyle, environment, psychology and genetics. A whole-system approach is needed.

- There was an epidemic of heart disease in the mid-20th century in the US, especially in men. Although life expectancy has increased since then, heart disease deaths have declined due to improvements in prevention, treatment and risk factor reduction.

- Healing the heart requires nurturing positive emotional states like empathy, compassion, forgiveness and devotion in addition to physical self-care. The heart is highly responsive to our experiences and mental/emotional state.

- Medical procedures like angioplasty are popular but limited. They aim to relieve symptoms rather than cure the disease or significantly prolong life. Lifestyle changes should be the first line of treatment before surgical options which also have risks and downsides.

- There are debates around cholesterol's role as the primary cause of heart disease. Heart health is far more complex with many contributing factors including diet, exercise, stress, environment, genetics, and psychology. A whole-system view is needed.

In summary, heart disease is a complex, multifactorial condition that requires a whole-system approach to understand and treat. Angioplasty and bypass provide limited benefits. Lifestyle changes and nurturing emotional well-being are key to prevention and healing. Simply targeting single factors like cholesterol is insufficient. A holistic perspective considers how all aspects of health influence the heart.

 

• Mara's life now seems stable and happy on the surface, but beneath there are signs of chronic stress and damage from years spent in "sympathetic overdrive." Her demanding career, turbulent 20s, and lingering insecurities are ongoing sources of stress.

• Although Mara exercises and watches her diet, she likely needs to make bigger changes to offset the health impacts of long-term stress. Recent research shows even stable, high-functioning lives can be undermined by unmanaged chronic stress.

• Humans often adapt well to increasing external demands but ignore internal stressors like thoughts, feelings, and attitudes. For example, entering a hospital causes physical stress but also worries, fear, loss of control, and anxiety. Ignoring these internal stresses leads to "sympathetic overdrive" and health issues.

• Most people have put themselves into a state of chronic "sympathetic overdrive" by overusing their body's fight-or-flight response to stress. This was once only for emergencies but now activates daily in response to work, relationships, commutes, and life's hassles. Though temporary, chronic activation causes inflammation, high blood pressure, and damage.

• While exercise, music, smartphones, and other tools help relieve acute stress, they do not offset chronic stress. Chronic stress management requires lifestyle changes like limiting overcommitment, spending time in nature, meditation, mindfulness, journaling, and learning coping strategies. Adaptation to chronic stress is not enough; we must find ways to limit its impact. 

• Mara's story illustrates the damaging effects of long-term sympathetic overdrive, even in high-functioning lives. Although stable now, years of accumulated stress may still be impacting her health in unseen ways. Making bigger changes to limit stress and increase restorative practices is key to wellness and longevity. Our ability to handle life's stresses ultimately determines our health and well-being.

The summary emphasizes the need to look beneath the surface of stable, high-functioning lives to understand and manage the impacts of chronic, long-term stress. Both external and internal factors contribute to stress, but internal factors are often ignored. Chronic stress causes real damage, even in times of happiness and stability. Offsetting these effects requires significant lifestyle changes to limit stress and activate the body's restorative abilities. Our ability to handle stress determines wellness.

 Here's a summary of the key points:

- Mara's marriage to Jason suffers from Jason's passive and passive-aggressive behavior, like forgetting to pick up their child after a fight. Mara has taken on an aggressive role to compensate, though she dislikes it. 

- Their lifestyle lacks aspects key to well-being and causes high stress, damaging them psychologically, behaviorally and physically. Daily life focuses on work and achievement, not emotional needs. Low-level stress is ignored. Relationships and physical activity decrease. There's no higher purpose. Health is addressed reactively.

- Psychological damage includes feeling tired, pressured, depressed, anxious, and irritable. Behavioral changes include issues at work and home, poor sleep, over/under eating, and substance use. Physical issues include fatigue, stomach problems, lowered immunity, inflammation, and heart disease. Chronic stress harms health, especially prenatal and child development.  

- The solution is addressing root causes holistically. Adapting to chronic stress causes harm. Disrupting one area impacts the whole system. Key is reducing stressors and improving lifestyle overall.

- Examples show the power of the mind-body connection. Some controlled bodily functions like temperature. Multiple personality disorder patients turned allergies on/off. Monks withstood cold through meditation.  Viewing them as connected enables self-healing and well-being. Though difficult, it's key to health and happiness. The body reflects the mind—to change the story, work with the bodymind as a whole.

- Some consciously control "involuntary" functions. Tao Porchon-Lynch, 98, unites mind and body for a long, meaningful life: prioritizing inner life; living present; building emotional resilience; translating beliefs to action; focusing on spiritual growth and love.

- Weight struggles stem from an unhealthy mind-body relationship, not weight itself. A mindful, self-compassionate approach develops a balanced food relationship and body image. Diets often express frustration with the body, see eating as a struggle between mind and body, focus on fantasizing about weight loss, lack willpower, envy others, feel guilty, and make empty promises.

- In summary, some people consciously control normally involuntary functions. Tao Porchon-Lynch's life shows uniting mind and body for longevity and meaning. Weight struggles stem more from an unhealthy mind-body relationship than weight itself. A mindful approach develops a balanced food relationship and body image.

 

• The mind and body are closely connected. Our thoughts, beliefs, and emotions can influence our health and physiology. This is evident in the placebo and nocebo effects.

• Negative beliefs about doctors and the healthcare system can trigger stress and anxiety, hampering health. It is better to evaluate experiences objectively based on facts. Emotional responses tend to be less rational.

• Positive beliefs and expectations promote healing through the placebo effect. They can influence physiology and health in medically significant ways that remain not fully understood. Negative beliefs have the opposite effect.

• Our interpretations of events and experiences filter our perception of reality. These interpretations shape our health and well-being. We can choose interpretations that promote health by adopting positive beliefs. 

• The healthcare system is imperfect, but doctors aim to help. Building positive relationships and maintaining confidence in one’s medical care helps reduce stress and leads to better health outcomes. Patients should advocate for themselves by asking questions and staying involved in their treatment.

• In summary, beliefs manifest in the body. Cultivating positive beliefs and a constructive approach to health care leads to improved well-being. Reducing negative preconceptions and building good doctor-patient relationships also helps. The mind-body connection means our thoughts and feelings directly impact our health. We have some ability to harness this connection through the choices we make.

 

• Beliefs significantly impact our health and well-being. Unhelpful beliefs can hinder healing, while positive, constructive beliefs support health. We should aim to become aware of our beliefs and work to adopt more positive ones.

• The body has a profound wisdom that has evolved over millions of years. The immune system in particular shows the intelligence of the body through its ability to protect us. We should respect the body's wisdom and see the mind-body partnership as equal. 

• There are many versions of the self we can identify with, including the outward self, private self, unconscious self, and higher self. The self we identify with shapes our experiences and interpretations. To heal and lead a conscious life, we must reconnect with aspects of self that have been lost.

• Suffering arises from how we relate to our experiences, not the experiences themselves. Physical pain is unavoidable but psychological suffering depends on our beliefs and interpretations. Overcoming suffering requires accessing a higher level of awareness and inner freedom. Meditation and mindfulness help us relate to pain in a calmer way.

• Darren's story shows how one man embarked on a journey of self-renewal after tragedy. He stepped away from society to focus inward, develop a new kind of knowledge, and become free of emotional baggage. Each of us should aim to get as close as possible to this ideal.

• In summary, beliefs, interpretations and the sense of self we identify with have a significant impact on our well-being. Recognizing the intelligence of the body and mind, overcoming unhelpful beliefs, accessing higher awareness, and reconnecting with our true self are keys to health, healing and an end of suffering. Meditation and inner work are pathways to get there.

 

The key points around inflammation and diet are:

• Limit inflammatory foods like red meat, saturated fats, sugar, white flour, and processed foods. These promote inflammation in the body.

• Focus on an anti-inflammatory diet high in whole foods like fish, nuts, olive oil, turmeric, and leafy greens. These help reduce inflammation.

• Balance your intake of omega-3 and omega-6 fats. Western diets contain too many omega-6 fats which increase inflammation. Aim for a ratio of 4:1 or less. Limit vegetable oils, grain-fed meats, and factory-farmed animal products. 

• To increase omega-3 fats, eat fatty fish, tree nuts, and seeds. Limit fatty nuts like cashews and macadamias. Avoid soybean oil and packaged foods with it. Choose leaner meat cuts and trim excess fat.

• Support a healthy gut microbiome through diet, probiotics, managing stress, and exercise. Eat less fat, sugar, and refined carbs; more fiber and prebiotics; avoid processed foods and excess alcohol. 

• Like reducing inflammation, managing stress requires a holistic approach including diet, exercise, sleep, mindfulness, and social connections. Stress and inflammation are closely linked.

• Don't label foods as "good" or "bad." Focus on balance, moderation, and an overall nutritious diet. No one food should be seen as a "miracle cure." The healthiest diets contain a variety of whole foods.

• Limit or avoid alcohol, gluten, and MSG. While moderate alcohol may have benefits for some, excess intake causes inflammation and health issues. Gluten and MSG sensitivity can trigger inflammation in susceptible people.

The key message is that inflammation and health depend on the overall diet and lifestyle, not any single food. An anti-inflammatory diet, healthy gut microbiome, stress management, and balance are most important for wellbeing. Moderation and variety are key principles. No "miracle foods" can outweigh the effects of an unhealthy lifestyle. Whole-system change is needed.

 

• Stress, especially chronic stress, accelerates aging by damaging cells and shortening telomeres, the caps on the ends of chromosomes. Managing stress through relaxation techniques, social support, and avoiding unhealthy coping mechanisms is key to aging well.

• Exercise, diet, sleep, and avoidance of toxins are lifestyle factors that can slow or potentially reverse aging. They do this by reducing inflammation, prompting the production of antioxidants, and promoting the release of hormones that stimulate new cell growth.

• Attitudes and beliefs about aging strongly influence the aging experience. Negative views tend to create self-fulfilling prophecies. Positive views are associated with healthier, longer lives. Consciously cultivating a youthful, growth-oriented mindset can help counter aging.

• Close relationships and social connections are the strongest predictors of healthy aging and longevity according to research. They reduce stress, encourage healthy behaviors, and give life deep meaning. Nurturing social bonds should be a top priority.

• Telomeres are structures in each cell that shorten with age. Shorter telomeres are linked to faster aging and disease risk. Maintaining telomere length is important for longevity and healthy aging. Factors like stress reduction, exercise, and diet can help preserve telomere length. An enzyme called telomerase can also replenish telomeres.

• Aging is highly individual depending on many variables. Genetics plays a role but lifestyle and environment have a strong influence over how a person ages through mechanisms like epigenetics. People have more control over aging than previously realized. Focusing on happiness and daily self-care are keys to aging well.

The key points are that aging is complex but lifestyle factors like beliefs, relationships, stress levels, and health habits have a significant influence. Managing these factors can help slow aging for a higher quality of life and greater longevity. Aging well ultimately comes down to the daily choices we make.

 

• Severe, chronic stress accelerates aging at the cellular level by shortening telomeres, structures that cap and protect chromosomes. Lifestyle changes can help boost telomerase, an enzyme that maintains telomere length, supporting cellular health and longevity.

• Psychological and emotional factors significantly impact cellular aging and longevity. Healthy lifestyle choices and positive beliefs about aging can optimize healthspan and lifespan.

• Lack of sleep has many detrimental health effects over time, including decreased immunity, weight gain, increased disease risks, and even higher mortality. 

• Adequate sleep is necessary for health, well-being, and homeostasis. Sitting too much and lack of activity disrupt the body’s natural cycles and harm health.

• Simple lifestyle changes like standing more, walking, meditating and optimizing the sleep environment can help improve sleep and overall health. The recommendations focus on easily sustainable habits. 

• Core beliefs shape our worldview, health, and well-being. Negative beliefs activate the body’s stress response, causing inflammation. Positive, flexible beliefs do the opposite. 

• Examining and cultivating positive core beliefs while challenging negative ones can promote healing and well-being. Open communication and considering other perspectives help in changing beliefs.

• Anger causes stress and inflammation. Most people use anger to lash out, defend themselves or intimidate others, ignoring the harm. Recognizing anger’s roots in beliefs and experiences enables choice in reactions. 

• To retrain reactions, recognize negative thoughts, reject them and state a realistic, optimistic replacement thought. Repeating this process helps establish new patterns. Mindfulness and meditation increase self-awareness and make retraining possible.

• Non-struggle embraces surrender, acceptance and flow rather than resisting life’s challenges. It leads to grace, peace and well-being. Choosing non-struggle requires releasing attachments to unhealthy beliefs and struggle. The benefits are substantial but the choice is individual.

• Struggles arise from beliefs that life must be difficult. Examining areas of personal struggle and the roots of attachments that perpetuate them allows non-struggle. Non-struggle means easing conflict, cooperating, and flowing with life.

 

1. Reaching enlightenment or higher consciousness involves choosing peace, awareness and love over their opposites in daily life. Modern life pulls us away from this path with stresses, distractions and busyness. 

2. The "pull of the self" means focusing your attention inward rather than being dominated by the outer world. Being outer-dominated leads to insecurity, pressure to conform, need for pleasure and fear of aging/death. Surrendering to the inner self leads to tranquility, fulfillment, acceptance of change, living in the now, creativity and lack of inner conflict.

3. Developing self-awareness means paying attention to your inner reality. Witnessing spiritual experiences leads to realizing your true self. Meditation and lifestyle changes help but one must follow the pull of the self. Life involves the outer world and inner self. Finding the unchanging essence within change evolves consciousness.

4. The true self is the goal of healing and life. When the mind quiets, you realize the freedom and joy of your true self—like arriving at your starting point with new understanding.

5. Alzheimer's destroys brain connections that form our memories, experiences, personalities and ability to relate. A person's whole life and relationships disappear as it progresses.

6. Negative thoughts can be challenged by asking if they're really true. Replace them with balanced, honest thoughts. Moods follow thoughts, so replace negatives with positives to improve mood and outlook.

7. Developing being centered and detached allows observing without reacting emotionally. This comes from meditation.

8. When emotionally reactive, use techniques like deep breathing, resting, walking outside, sighing or toning to settle your body and mind. These skills can lift you from negative states.

9. The spiritual path involves going beyond body and mind to connect with your soul or higher consciousness. This unpredictable journey changes you in unforeseeable ways. 

10. The highest evolution or enlightenment means knowing your true self through detached self-awareness or witnessing. Here you observe your thoughts and experiences without identifying with or controlling them. You feel calm, whole and unattached.

11. Spiritual experiences are personal and verified through having them yourself. Saints and sages accessed them through the human nervous system we all have. The key is developing the ability to turn awareness inward to your source or true self.

 

There is hope for progress against Alzheimer’s disease and cancer due to several recent breakthroughs:

• Alzheimer’s research shows amyloid plaques form first and trigger tau tangles, the hallmark brain abnormalities. Targeting plaques could help prevent Alzheimer’s. A healing lifestyle also helps build cognitive reserve and reduce risk. 

• New research links neuroinflammation to Alzheimer’s symptoms. Anti-inflammatory strategies may help prevent and treat Alzheimer’s. However, some inflammation is beneficial for brain health. A balanced approach is needed.

• Cancer deaths and diagnoses continue to decline due to prevention, early detection, targeted treatments, and reduced harm from treatments. However, increasing the age at which people die from cancer is the key measure of progress. Up to half of cancers are preventable through lifestyle changes.

• Cancer is increasingly seen as a manageable chronic disease, depending on the type. Not all cancers require aggressive treatment, especially slow-growing ones in older patients. Doctors' approaches vary, so seeking multiple opinions is helpful.

• Managing stress and fear is important for health, cancer patients and survivors. Learning optimistic information about cancer progress can help. Addressing irrational fears of cancer may aid progress against the disease.

• Epigenetics links life experiences to changes in gene activity and health. Positive experiences may help reduce cancer risk and improve outcomes through epigenetic effects. But linking bad experiences to cancer could increase stress. 

• Lifestyle, early detection and new treatments are improving cancer outcomes. But continued progress depends on increasing the age at which people diagnosed with cancer die. Reducing fear and isolation are also key.

• The authors thank their supporters and colleagues. Deepak Chopra is a physician and author. Rudolph Tanzi is an expert on Alzheimer's disease and professor of neurology.

The key message is that lifestyle choices, scientific progress, and a balanced perspective on health threats can inspire hope and fuel continued advancement against diseases like Alzheimer’s, cancer and others. Managing stress and avoiding fear-mongering are also important for cultivating health and wellbeing.
