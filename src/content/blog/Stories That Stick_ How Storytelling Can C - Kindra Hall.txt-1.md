- The author recalls using Extra gum in high school to gain social acceptance. Extra gum used to dominate the market but has now declined significantly. 

- All businesses struggle with bridging a “gap” to deliver value to customers. For Extra gum, the gap was between the company and potential customers.

- There are many ways to bridge gaps in business: advertising, social media, etc. But the most powerful tool is storytelling. Stories have a profound ability to influence how people think and behave.

- For example, a story about the origins of a product can make people view it differently and build an emotional connection. The story of Eight & Bob cologne captivated the author's husband and made him want to buy it. 

- Stories also have the power to transform companies by helping leaders articulate why they do what they do. This spreads to employees and customers.

- In the end, storytelling is the most effective way to bridge gaps of understanding and shared purpose. It allows businesses to profitably deliver value to people.

 

- Achieving business goals requires overcoming many obstacles and gaps. The key is to build strong bridges to connect the gaps. 
- There are three essential elements to building effective bridges: gaining attention, influence, and transformation. Many attempts fail because they only focus on one or two elements. 
- Examples of ineffective bridge building include excessive advertising that people ignore, sales presentations with too much information that audiences can't process, repeating mission statements without really motivating employees, social media posts that no one engages with, etc. 
- Extra gum faced declining sales and needed to build better bridges to connect with customers. Initially, they focused on their long-lasting flavor feature, but that didn't work. Research found 95% of gum buying decisions are made unconsciously. 
- Extra realized they needed to connect with customers at a deeper level. The solution was storytelling. Stories are what stick with people and can effectively capture attention, influence, and transform.
- The author has experience with storytelling outside of business. She told her first story at age 11 and continued in school and at storytelling festivals. She believes storytelling is the key to overcoming obstacles and bridging gaps in business.

In summary, the key message is that storytelling is the most effective way to achieve the three elements required to build strong bridges and close important gaps in business. While goals may be straightforward, achieving them is challenging, and storytelling can be a transformational solution.

 

The author discusses how storytelling is an effective way to capture attention, influence audiences, and transform mindsets. Storytelling works because:

1. It captivates audiences by drawing them into the story. This makes them willing participants, not resistant or inattentive. 

2. Once audiences are immersed in a story, their attitudes and perspectives shift to align with the story. Their resistance and scrutiny fade away. They become open to the message and ideas in the story.

3. Stories have a lasting impact and can transform how people think and act. The messages and ideas from stories stick with audiences and become a part of them. 

The author shares examples of how storytelling transformed businesses and connected with customers. For example:

- Extra gum tapped into the emotional motivation behind why people share gum - a desire for togetherness and connection. They created a two-minute video telling the story of two high school sweethearts, Sarah and Juan. Though the story, Extra gum associated itself with deeper human emotions and relationships. 

- The author worked with a transit company and title companies to discover and share the noble causes behind their work. The transit company saw itself as helping customers keep their promises. The title companies saw themselves as making the American dream of homeownership possible. By telling these transformational stories, the companies elevated their brands and connected with customers in a deeper way.

In summary, storytelling is a powerful way to build bridges with customers and stakeholders. When done right, storytelling effortlessly captures attention, influences mindsets, and creates lasting change. Businesses can use storytelling to tap into deeper motivations and share more meaningful messages.

 

- The Maricopa Medical Center is a county hospital in Arizona that provides healthcare to low-income and uninsured patients. Despite serving a disadvantaged population, it has a reputation for excellence. 

- The hospital relies on public funds and private donations to operate. The Maricopa Health Foundation holds an annual fundraising gala called the Copa Ball to raise private donations. In 2014, they were worried about lackluster fundraising.

- Fundraising is challenging for county hospitals because the people who use and benefit from the hospital often can’t afford to donate. The previous year, the foundation had doctors give presentations about the hospital’s needs but fundraising fell short of goals.

- There were additional challenges in 2014. A healthcare funding bond was up for vote, diverting potential donations. The audience at the Copa Ball had already been asked for money many times. 

- The author argues that the issue wasn’t about convincing people to donate by emphasizing the hospital’s importance. The audience already cared. The issue was connecting the audience’s caring to action by bridging the gap between the low-income patients and high-income donors. An appeal to rationality and logic alone wouldn’t be enough.

- The author proposed using storytelling to build empathy and make an emotional connection between the donors and patients. By sharing stories of real patients, the audience could see themselves or their loved ones in the patients’ struggles and be motivated to act. Stories were a way to “hack into the audience’s nervous system” and motivate them to donate.

The key points are: 1) County hospitals face unique fundraising challenges. 2) Repeating facts about needs may not motivate donations. 3) There is a gap between the patients who use county hospitals and the donors they rely on. 4) Stories can build empathy and emotional connections to bridge that gap. 5) Stories “hack” the nervous system to motivate action.

 

The key insight is that stories have a unique ability to capture people's attention, build trust, and motivate generosity. The foundation needed to close the gap between donors and the hospital. They achieved this by having speakers share personal stories at their fundraising event instead of just making logical pleas. 

A neuroscientist named Paul Zak found that stories increase oxytocin, the "trust and bonding" hormone, which then leads to more generosity. Stories also increase attention and cortisol. Zak showed in experiments that people donated more to charity after watching an emotional story versus just facts.

The foundation chose stories and then found speakers to share them, rather than just choosing prestigious speakers. The stories included a man who received facial reconstruction surgery he couldn't afford, a former government official whose father received immediate care during a stroke, and a woman who was hit by a car and taken to the hospital. 

Sharing these stories created an emotional connection with the audience and led to the most donations in the history of the event. The stories built trust and captured attention, motivating generosity according to Zak's findings. Overall, the key is that personal stories, not just logic, are needed to motivate people and close the gap between a cause and its potential supporters.

 

• Stories have a powerful ability to captivate, influence, and transform the brain. When we hear stories, our brains synchronize with the storyteller’s brain. Stories elicit emotions and cause chemical changes in our brain that make them memorable. 

• Not all stories are equally effective. For stories to have a lasting impact, they must be compelling and well-told. Merely recounting information or events does not constitute an effective story.

• Professor Keith Quesenberry predicted that Anheuser-Busch’s 2014 Super Bowl commercial “Puppy Love” would be the favorite. He based his prediction not on the ad’s use of cute puppies, attractive actors, or an emotional song, but on the fact that it told a story. 

• The belief in the power of storytelling has become widely and uncritically accepted today. But this was not the case just over a decade ago. When the author was in graduate school defending her master’s thesis on storytelling in 2004, the idea was still quite radical and faced a lot of skepticism. Her thesis advisor warned her that focusing on storytelling was “fluffy” and might damage her credibility and career.

• The author’s graduate research found that the most effective leaders were master storytellers. Stories gave them a way to connect, inspire, and motivate their teams. The best stories were authentic, tapping into the leader’s own experiences and values. Impersonal facts and statistics lacked the emotive power of stories.

• Stories build connections between people by synchronizing their brains and eliciting emotions. This allows leaders to bridge gaps, bring people together, and create lasting change. While storytelling may have seemed like a “fluffy” topic years ago, research has proven its significant impact and importance.

That covers the key highlights and main takeaways from the chapter on what makes a great story and why storytelling is so powerful. Please let me know if you would like me to explain or expand on any part of the summary.

 

- The author had to defend her thesis on the role of storytelling in business during a preliminary defense meeting with professors. At the time, storytelling was not commonly accepted as an important business topic. She argues that storytelling is essential for human cooperation and survival. 

- Years later, storytelling became very popular in business. However, the author argues that people have lost track of what actually constitutes a good story. Just using the word "story" or "storytelling" does not make something an actual story. 

- For example, the author points out that product packaging claiming to tell a company's "story" often does not actually contain a story in the true sense. A real story has characters, tension, and follows the arc of exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution that people are familiar with from stories they've heard. 

- The author argues that while it's good storytelling has gained acceptance, the pendulum has swung too far. Now anything and everything is labeled as "storytelling" or a "story." But calling something a story when it lacks the elements of a story will ultimately lead to lack of meaning and understanding. 

- Real, impactful stories have characters, tension, and follow a story arc. The author implies that to achieve the true benefits of storytelling, businesses and leaders need to understand how to craft and share real stories, not just label information or platitudes as stories. Using the word "story" is not enough.

- In summary, the key argument is that storytelling has become a buzzword, but its true meaning and power have been lost. For storytelling to achieve its potential, businesses must rediscover the elements of what makes a real story. Simply calling something a story does not make it so. 

Does this summary accurately capture the key highlights and arguments from the passage? Let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on any part of the summary.

 

• Stories are powerful but there is a lack of actual storytelling in business. Many mistake branding, data, stats for stories. 

• A real story was told by Warby Parker. They included a story on a hanky in their product packaging about how the company was founded.

• The 2014 Super Bowl commercial “Puppy Love” by Budweiser was the most popular ad. Research found that what made ads successful was whether they told an actual story, not just humor, cute characters, music, etc. 

• To tell an effective simple story for business, you need four components:

1. Identifiable characters: not a company, value or group but actual characters we can connect with. 

2. Authentic emotion: emotion felt by the characters that elicits empathy in the audience. No emotion means no empathy and less impact.

3. A significant moment: a specific point that zooms in on an experience. Instead of broad strokes, a tight focus on a particular moment. 

4. Specific details: concrete descriptions to help the audience visualize the story. Vague, generic details are forgettable.

• An example was a school in NYC wanting to share a story about opening a new international school branch. Their first attempts were too broad. When they focused on specific moments with details, like watching kids try new spicy food together, their story became compelling.

• A simple story structure: set the scene, introduce characters, build to a moment, share what’s at stake and how it resolves. Describe feelings and specific details throughout. Keep it short, around 30 to 90 seconds.

• Use the four components and simple structure for your business stories to resonate and stick with people. But keep it authentic - don’t make up stories. Share real moments from your business experiences.

 

- Effective stories include specific details and moments to draw the audience in and help them relate. Vague, generic stories lack impact. 
- There are four key components to an effective story:

1. A relatable character: Someone the audience can relate to and care about.

2. Emotion: Stories evoke emotion in the audience. Without emotion, stories lack power.

3. A specific moment: Narrowing in on a particular moment in time helps bring the story to life. Broad, general stories lack focus.

4. Specific details: Descriptive details, imagery, and sensory language help the audience visualize the story. They signal that the storyteller understands the audience.

- These four components were tested in a survey of over 1,600 people. Messages with more of these story components were found to be significantly more compelling, memorable, and impactful.

- Stories follow a simple three-act structure:

1. Normal: Establish the normal situation and context. Help the audience understand the status quo.

2. Explosion: Something changes to disrupt the normal. This creates conflict and drama. 

3. New normal: Resolution of the conflict. The story ends in a new, changed state.

- The “normal” part is critical for establishing context and helping the audience care. Without it, the story lacks power and connection. The “explosion” creates drama and conflict to propel the story. And the “new normal” provides resolution.

- This simple story framework and the four key components provide a checklist to craft impactful stories. While big budgets and flashy elements can attract attention, only story can transform and inspire action.

 

- The news usually focuses on dramatic events like robberies, fires or accidents but lacks context about the people involved, making it hard for audiences to care. 
- To tell an engaging story, you need to establish the normal first—introduce characters, their emotions and details that help the audience relate. This helps them understand the characters and become invested.
- The explosion is when something changes—it could be big or small, good or bad. It's the event that disrupts the normal.
- The new normal shows how things are different now. It could share a lesson, show how characters grew or issue a call to action. The new normal gives the story purpose.
- There are four essential types of stories in business:

1. The value story shows how a product or service solves a problem or improves lives. It taps into the audience's pain points and helps them see the benefits.  Workiva struggled to sell their software until they started telling stories showing how it saved time, ensured accuracy and improved work-life balance.

 

The executive achieved his goal of reducing stress and work inefficiencies by using Workiva's reporting platform. The platform connected his reports and slides to the reporting team's, so whenever a number changed, his reports updated automatically. This eliminated double-checking, meetings outside of work hours, and concerns about data consistency. The company benefited from improved reporting and higher employee satisfaction. The executive could spend more time exercising, and he completed his first triathlon. 

Workiva faced the challenge of overcoming the temptation to focus on features and functions rather than communicating the value and benefits to customers. They used a value story to bridge the gap between their product and its value. Value stories have a psychological impact and convince people to become customers.

Rather than providing too much information, which engages the mind's System 2 and causes cognitive strain, value stories engage System 1, which operates quickly and intuitively. System 1 responds well to stories, allowing people to understand ideas more easily. In contrast, lists, bullet points, comparisons, features, and benefits activate the tedious System 2 thinking.

To illustrate, the gelato shop example shows how switching from displaying flavors intuitively with colors and images to listing flavors in words caused frustration for customers. Similarly, a credit card pitch listing rates and fees fails to resonate, whereas sharing a story about the benefits of redemption miles for an upgraded trip would make a persuasive case. In summary, value stories bridge logical information and emotional benefits, easing the path to "yes."

 

The author describes an experience of speaking at a digital marketing conference where the presentations were highly technical. The author felt out of place and considered cancelling their presentation. However, the next day, the author gave a presentation focused on storytelling and connecting with customers emotionally. The presentation was very well received, suggesting that digital marketers had become overly focused on data and metrics, and had lost sight of the human component of marketing. 

The author then describes Chelsea Scholz’s experience in a similar role at Unbounce, a company that provides tools for improving website conversion. Scholz felt Unbounce had also become overly reliant on data and metrics, “talking at people instead of to people.” Scholz advocated for a shift to focus more on storytelling and the value provided to customers. Her team created a video focused on how Unbounce’s products had helped a real customer, which led to greater engagement and interest.

The key message is that marketers and businesses should not become overly reliant on data, metrics and talking about product features. They need to remember the human component by telling stories that convey the real value and benefits to customers. A value story, with emotional components and characters, can resonate far more than a list of product specs. The example of Apple’s “Misunderstood” commercial is given, showing how a story about a product’s role in bringing a family together was far more impactful than a commercial focused on features alone would have been.

In summary, the key to making a “value story shift” is:

1. Remember your customers are human. Do not become overly focused on data and metrics. 

2. Tell stories that convey the real value and benefits to customers. Focus on the problems your product or service solves.

3. Create a narrative with emotional components and characters. Help the audience envision themselves in the story. 

4. The story should follow a format of normal life - disruption - resolution, where your product or service provides the resolution. 

5. Choose a specific moment or event to bring the story to life. Engage the audience.

6. The value story should make an emotional connection and illustrate why your product is “so much more” than just its features.

Does this summary accurately reflect the key highlights and main takeaways from the author's discussion? Let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand the summary in any way.

 

The speaker was invited to give a keynote at a digital marketing conference but bombed on stage during her first attempt. However, she persisted and told stories to connect with the audience the next day. Her talk ended up being very successful. 

The story reinforces that while data and metrics are important in digital marketing, connecting with humans through stories is key. If you can't talk about your actual product, focus on the problem your product solves for customers. Tell a story about their pain points and how life improves when those problems are solved.

The example used is Unbounce, a company that builds landing pages and conversion tools for marketers. They created a video to hype a new product called Convertables but couldn't reveal details about the actual product yet. So they told a story about a struggling marketer and how his world transformed once Unbounce's new tool launched. The video resonated and exceeded their goals.

The key takeaway is: start with a story to draw people in, then add facts and data, and end with a story. Wrap information in an engaging story, like putting a spoonful of sugar with medicine to help it go down smoothly. Use the Steller storytelling framework:

1. Normal: Describe the customer's problem or pain. 
2. Explosion: Introduce your solution. 
3. New normal: Show how life improves with the solution.

Following this framework creates an effective value story. Start with your customer's struggles, show how you solve them, and end on the better outcome. But remember, you still need facts and data too—just cushion them within an engaging story.

 

1. Identifiable Characters: The value story must have a character, a person the audience can relate to. The character represents the customer or user, not the product itself. Details about the character help the audience connect with and care about the story.

2. Authentic Emotion: The story should tap into the emotions and pain points of the target customer. Figure out what keeps your customers up at night or what their biggest worries and stresses are. Then show how your product or service relieves that emotional burden. 

3. A Moment: The story should capture a specific moment in time that demonstrates the problem you solve. For example, describe the moment your customer discovers or experiences the value of your product. This moment is often connected to the “explosion” or turning point in the story.

4. Specific Details: Include vivid details in your story that will make the scene familiar and realistic for your target audience. Mention things like the pizza they order during late meetings or the pens they get from sales reps. These types of details show you understand their world. But only include details you actually know to be true.

5. The Real Value: An effective value story makes the benefits and impact of your product easy to understand. It shifts the focus to your customer and how you relieve their pain points and frustrations. The story should captivate your audience and convince them of the value you provide.

In summary, a compelling value story has identifiable characters, authentic emotion, a pivotal moment, vivid details, and conveys the real value and benefits you offer to customers. The story should revolve around your customer, not your product. When done well, a value story can be a powerful way to connect with your audience and communicate the impact of your solution.

 

• The founders of Airbnb were two roommates struggling to pay rent in expensive San Francisco. 

• When a big design conference came to town and all the hotels were booked, they had the idea to rent out air mattresses in their living room to attendees. 

• It was a success and gave them the idea to turn it into a business where people could rent out their space for an "awesome experience."

• They started the company on credit cards and racked up debt, even repacking cereal to pay it off. 

• They spread the word by pitching small bloggers who might give them attention. 

• The early stories of struggle and perseverance have become part of Airbnb's company lore and were key to raising money and gaining customers in the beginning.

• The founder story showed their vision, passion, and hustle, which investors and early customers found appealing. It bridged the gap between a risky startup and people willing to take a chance on them.

• A compelling founder story, especially for a startup, can be a key way to stand out, raise capital, gain customers, and attract talent. Airbnb is a prime example of this.

So in summary, the key points are:

1) Every company has a founder story. 
2) For startups, the founder story is crucial for raising money, gaining customers, and attracting talent.
3) A good founder story shows vision, passion, and perseverance, which appeals to investors and customers willing to take a risk. 
4) Airbnb is a prime example of using story to launch a startup. Their story of struggle and hustle to get the company off the ground has become company lore.

Does this help summarize the key highlights? Let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on any part of the summary.

 

• The idea of turning your home into a business by renting out space to strangers seemed crazy at first. Investors and venture capitalists initially rejected Airbnb's business model and idea. 

• Entrepreneurs face the challenge of convincing investors to take a risk on their idea without much proof of success. They have to persuade investors their idea is worth investing in.

• Brian Chesky, the cofounder of Airbnb, was able to overcome skepticism by telling his story. His story demonstrated his passion and commitment, which convinced investors like Jeff Jordan to invest $112 million in Airbnb.

• Telling a compelling founder story can bridge the gap between entrepreneur and investor. It shows why the founder is uniquely suited to make the idea work and overcome challenges. The story generates faith in the founder and company.

• Entrepreneurs also have to differentiate themselves from many competitors. There are over 500,000 new businesses started each month. Telling your authentic founder story is a way to stand out.

• Jerry Meek, the founder of Desert Star Construction, used storytelling to differentiate his luxury home building company. He shared stories of the three generations of his family in the construction business. This showcased his passion, experience, and commitment to quality. 

• Stories give companies a competitive advantage by demonstrating their purpose and values. Companies should share stories internally and externally to spread their vision and connect with stakeholders. Authentic stories are the most compelling.

The key message is that storytelling, especially sharing your authentic founder story, is a powerful way for entrepreneurs and businesses to persuade investors, attract customers, and differentiate themselves from competitors. Stories create connections built on faith and shared values. For startups and new companies, a well-told founder story can be the difference between success and failure.

 

- Desert Star Construction is a luxury home builder in Arizona founded by Jerry Meek.

- Although the company had been successful, Jerry struggled to differentiate his company from competitors who made similar promises about quality, service, and excellence. 

- Jerry realized he needed to tell his story to showcase his passion for building and connect with potential clients on an emotional level.

- Jerry's story wasn't dramatic, but it highlighted how he's been fascinated with building since childhood. He built elaborate forts as a kid and dreamed of designing homes.

- Jerry decided to share his story through a video. They filmed footage of him telling his story along with shots of one of his construction sites.

- On the day of the filming, Jerry had the opportunity to pitch building a enormous home for a high-profile client. The video team rushed to get Jerry's footage before he had to leave for the pitch.

- Although the outcome of the pitch isn't specified, the implication is that sharing Jerry's authentic story made a positive impression and helped differentiate Desert Star Construction.

- The key takeaway is that a founder's story, even if not dramatic, can resonate with customers and set a brand apart. Authentic stories tap into human desires and forge emotional connections.

 

- Jerry, the founder of Desert Star Construction, used a story from his childhood about building forts to differentiate his company during a pitch. The story helped him land a big job by allowing him to connect with the client in a memorable way.

- Founder stories can help bridge 3 key gaps: the investor gap, the customer gap, and the talent gap. By telling a genuine story, founders can inspire others to join their team and help scale the business. 

- There are a few places founders can look to find their story:

1. Go way back to their childhood or early experiences that sparked their passion for the business. For example, the financial advisor who loved playing with money as a little girl.

2. Remember the “there has to be a better way” moment when they realized the standard way of doing things wasn’t good enough. For example, the Warby Parker founders who wanted to offer stylish eyewear at lower prices.

3. Look for the “blood, sweat, and tears” moments when things were difficult. For example, the mom who broke down aluminum frames to raise money to start her baby moccasin business. Authentic stories of struggle and hard work are compelling.

- The key is to find a memorable story that showcases your passion, work ethic, and perseverance. While success stories are nice, stories of overcoming difficulties are often even more inspiring. A good founder story can make the difference in connecting with investors, customers, and potential team members.

 

The founder story is not the same as a value story. A founder story is about the founder, while a value story focuses on the product or service. It's important not to confuse the two.

Don't avoid telling your founder story just because you're tired of telling it. Your story may feel repetitive to you, but it will be new to anyone hearing it for the first time. Think of it like actors in a Broadway show—they perform the same show night after night, but for the audience, it's a new experience. 

Anyone can tell a founder story, not just the actual founder. If you know the story, share it, just adjust how you introduce it based on your relationship to the founder and company. For example, say you heard the story during your interview or when you first started working there. Then share the story in the third person.

Don't let a reluctant founder prevent you from sharing their story. Founders may resist telling their story for various reasons, but their reasons are often misguided or irrelevant. Gently but persistently encourage the founder to share their story. If needed, you can even draft the story for them to show how compelling and non-self-aggrandizing it can be. People connect with stories about real people and the founder story reminds them there are real people behind the company.

The components of a good founder story include:

•Identifiable characters: Focus on the founder and their journey. The founder should be the central character.

•Relatable emotions: Share the emotional ups and downs of starting the company. People will connect with the founder's hopes, struggles, and perseverance. 

•Authentic details: Use specific details to make the story compelling and help the audience visualize what it was really like. Mention key events, moments of truth, and turning points.

•A narrative arc: Have a clear beginning, middle, and end. Start with the founder's motivation or key insight, build up to struggles and obstacles, climax with a breakthrough, and end on an inspiring note.

Does this help summarize the key points about crafting and sharing an effective founder story? Let me know if you have any other questions!

 

• The founder story is essential to help people know, believe in, and root for a company. But many companies mess up their founder stories.

• The author's team was once approached by a founder who wanted to tell his company's story. However, the founder didn't actually want the story to focus on people or have identifiable characters. He just wanted it to be about "commitment to excellence" and "better ingredients." This is a mistake, as people connect to stories with characters, not faceless entities. The company ended up failing to gain traction.

• A good founder story should include authentic emotion. For investors, show how you've handled adversity and obstacles. For customers, show your passion for the solution or product. For new talent, show your enthusiasm and passion for the work. A balance of emotions, both positive and negative, makes for a compelling story.

• The story should identify a specific moment in time, like when you first opened your doors or launched your product. Saying something like "I'll never forget the day..." helps give the audience a concrete moment to envision. 

• Include specific details that your target audience can relate to. Talk about details that are universal human experiences. The story should highlight that you're human, not just facts and figures.

• The founder story is your best chance to humanize your business and connect with people. You often don't get a second chance to share an impactful story. The story should start with the people behind the company, not facts and figures.

• An example is shared of an artist at an expo who originally just shared basic facts about his glass bowls and company origin. But when he shared his full founder story the next day, it was much more compelling. His story was about following his passion for art despite pressure to pursue law. He learned glassblowing in secret and built his company from discarded scraps of glass. This story humanized him and allowed people to connect with his purpose and passion.

The key takeaway is that founder stories which focus on the human elements—emotion, passion, purpose, moments, details—are the most compelling and help audiences connect with and support a company. Founder stories should be a priority, not an afterthought.

 

The key to growing a company beyond its early stages is aligning and inspiring a team. Leaders can use stories, specifically purpose stories, to accomplish this. Purpose stories give teams a reason to show up and work together toward a shared goal. 

While profit is important, purpose is a more powerful motivator. Research shows that companies aligned around a purpose other than profit tend to be more profitable over time. Many companies today build purpose into their business model, like Toms, Bombas, and Warby Parker.

Humans have an innate need for purpose and meaning. If leaders don't provide a purpose, teams will create their own, often in unhelpful ways. Purpose stories address this by giving teams an aligned sense of meaning and inspiration.

Purpose stories have two main benefits:

1. Alignment. They align teams around goals, values, culture, and strategy. This leads to shared understanding and more effective collaboration. Research shows storytelling improves team mental models and performance.

2. Inspiration. They give teams a motivating reason to act. Purpose stories tap into human needs for purpose and meaning, inspiring team members to work together toward a shared vision.

In summary, purpose stories are a tool leaders can use to unite and motivate teams. They are essential for growing and scaling an organization. Purpose stories create alignment through shared understanding and inspiration through tapping into fundamental human needs.

 

A student was seriously injured in an accident because the emergency response team did not coordinate well and work together. Some groups in the study watched a video that just emphasized the importance of teamwork and timing. Other groups heard a story of the injured student to illustrate why teamwork and coordination are so crucial. 

The groups that heard the story came away with a much stronger understanding of the need for collaboration. Storytelling is an effective way to unite and motivate groups. Stories have been used for years to align groups around a common goal.

For example, at a tech company's national sales conference, the VP of sales told a story of taking his daughter to an expensive dinner to impart some wisdom to her before she went off to college. However, she ended up pointing out to him that he was wearing two different socks, undercutting his message about paying attention to details. He used this story to acknowledge that the company had also failed to practice what they preached, but promised to do better at being consistent going forward. The story was an effective way to frame an awkward but important message.

Another example is how Sodexo, a food services company, wanted to convey their passion for food. They used a story from a chef about his childhood in India, eating with his extended family. Although the family eventually dispersed, he spent years trying to recreate the dishes from his childhood to recapture those memories. He eventually realized that it was really about the experience of people coming together over food and sharing stories - that is what he aims to create in his role as a chef at Sodexo. This story helped to show what Sodexo's love of food really means in a way that just stating it could not.

In summary, stories can be very persuasive in aligning groups around ideas and values. They help to create emotional connections and shared understanding that lead to coordinated action and motivation.

 

The key to a successful purpose story is having a clear message you want to convey. Once you identify your message, you need to find a story that illustrates that message. The story should reinforce the main point you want your audience to understand. 

However, purpose stories require precision. If the story does not match the message well, it can backfire and reflect poorly on the storyteller. It is important to spend time ensuring the story reinforces the key message.

One technique for finding a purpose story is to ask yourself when you learned the lesson or message you want to share. Recall a time you discovered that truth or insight. That experience can then be developed into an impactful story.

For example, a young executive named Michael wanted to tell his team not to give up in challenging times. He asked himself when he had learned that lesson, and it led him to recall struggling as a freshman trying to make the water polo team. Through hard work and persistence, he not only made the team but helped lead them to a championship. That story illustrated his message of perseverance in the face of difficulties. 

A single purpose story, when well-matched to the message, can unite and inspire groups. But the storyteller must take care to find an authentic experience that reinforces the precise insight they aim to share. With practice, leaders can become quite adept at using stories to motivate their teams.

 

- Michael was a self-proclaimed hothead who worked hard to manage his temper and channel his emotions into sharper play. 
- He worked hard and was recruited to play water polo for UCLA. At first, he kept up with the demands but began to slip and lose focus. 
- His coach told him he had to step up or quit the team. Michael quit during his senior year.
- He regretted that decision and shared the story with a group of discouraged salespeople. Through his story, he told them they faced a similar choice - to work hard through tough times or quit. He said he refused to quit until they win. 
- The story and message inspired the sales team and helped turn around the company during a recession.

The key components of a purpose story are:

1. Identifiable characters: The storyteller, in this case Michael, is usually the main character. The story is designed to prompt the audience to put themselves in the character's shoes. Details about the character help the audience relate.

2. Authentic emotions: The success of a purpose story depends on sharing genuine emotions. Vulnerability connects the storyteller and audience. Emotions don't have to be dramatic but a willingness to be vulnerable is important.

3. A moment: A specific moment in time, like a realization or change in perspective, helps make the story compelling. Slowing down the description of that moment draws the audience in. 

4. A lesson: The ultimate goal of a purpose story is to share a lesson, message or call to action. The story builds up to that lesson, giving it more impact. The lesson inspires and motivates the audience.

In summary, a good purpose story uses a relatable character and emotional vulnerability to share a lesson or message in a compelling way. The storyteller's experience becomes a inspiration and call to action for the audience.

 

- The success of a story often depends on including specific, relatable details. This helps the audience connect with the story and see themselves in it.

- A study found that children who knew more about their family history were happier and had higher self-esteem. The authors wondered if the same would apply to companies and employees. They surveyed employees and found that those who knew stories about the company's history and challenges were more engaged and felt the work was meaningful. 

- Company culture is built through storytelling. Employees feel more connected to companies when they know the stories of its ups and downs, origins, and triumphs over adversity. These stories give them a sense of belonging and shared purpose.

- Leaders need to engage their teams through storytelling just as they do with customers and investors. The stories have to be authentic and capture key events in the company's history to be effective. 

- The customer story is one of the most powerful types of stories but also one of the hardest to get right. It relies on capturing authentic stories from customers about their experiences. These carry credibility that a company's own marketing messages lack.

- The example of Native Deodorant shows how a company can capture customer stories effectively. Native has a clear brand message and purpose but enhances it by sharing stories from real customers about their experiences with the product. This helps build trust in the brand.

- In contrast, the fictional example of Acme Deodorant shows how weak branding and marketing that lacks authentic stories fails to resonate. Simply attributing qualities to a product or experience that the audience knows aren't really meaningful or impactful comes across as inauthentic. 

The key takeaway is that purposeful, well-crafted stories—especially those from customers—are essential for engaging both employees and customers. They provide meaning, build culture, and establish credibility. But the stories have to be authentic to achieve their desired impact.

 

• Consumers increasingly trust online reviews and ratings to determine which businesses they patronize. Positive reviews and high ratings make consumers much more likely to choose a business. 

• However, many consumers are skeptical about fake or biased reviews. Customer stories can help address this skepticism by providing credible first-person accounts of experiences with a product or service.

• Customer stories differ from value stories. Value stories are told by a company to demonstrate the value of their offering. Customer stories are told by actual customers about their authentic experiences. 

• Customer stories are more credible because they come from a third-party source with nothing to gain. Hearing something from an actual customer means more than hearing the same thing from the company selling the product.

• The source of a story has a big impact on how believable and persuasive it is. McDonald's learned this the hard way when an ad featuring a customer story provoked outrage because the story seemed exploitative coming from the company, even though the same story told by an actual customer may have resonated positively. 

• In summary, customer stories can be a powerful way for businesses to build trust and connection with potential customers in a skeptical world. By ceding control of the storytelling to real customers, companies can gain credibility that translates into more sales and loyalty.

 

The author shares a story of ordering tomato juice on a flight with her mom, which reminded her mom of the author's dad, who always orders tomato juice when flying. This small similarity made the author feel a deep sense of connection and pride in relation to her dad. The author notes that her dad is still alive, showing that such small connections can be meaningful even when loved ones are still present. 

The author then discusses a McDonald's ad about a boy who finds a connection with his late father over a fast food sandwich. The author questions whether this was based on a real story and critiques how, if so, the ad agency may have ruined the authenticity and power of the original story by having actors portray it rather than using the real people involved.

The author highlights how the details in customer stories, like those shared on Native Deodorant's website, help to make them feel authentic and believable. She notes that while the stories should be guided to fit a given framework, editing them too heavily can make them feel less real. The details shared in the stories, like a customer's age or specific activities, also help to paint a picture of the type of people who use the product.

The author then outlines two rules for collecting customer stories:

1. You must ask. Companies need to prompt customers to share their stories, whether through follow-up emails, online review requests, or other means. Native Deodorant sends personalized emails from a real staff member a few days after a purchase to request customer feedback and stories.

2. Ask specifically and you shall receive. By providing customers with specific questions and a framework for their stories, companies can elicit the types of responses they're looking for. Native Deodorant's email provides a framework matching the normal-explosion-new normal story structure, leading many customers to share stories in this format. 

Finally, the author notes that curating and sharing customer stories is key. She suggests that companies can share customer stories on their product packaging, websites, social media, and more to put the stories they've collected on display. While her example of printing stories on cereal boxes likely wouldn't translate well today, the general principle of sharing stories where customers will see them still applies.

 

The key to finding stories within your business is to look everywhere. Some places to explore for potential stories include:

•Your website and social media: Look for customer reviews, comments and stories that shine a light on your impact. 

•Surveys and interviews: Talk to your customers and employees to discover their experiences and moments of truth. Ask open-ended questions to reveal stories.

•Observe interactions: Watch how your product or service is used and experienced. Look for those small details and moments that reveal a bigger story.

•Dig into your company history: Explore the key events, challenges, milestones and people that shaped your company. There are stories to be found in the past.

•Notice everyday moments: Pay attention to the small, seemingly insignificant interactions and events. These are often where authentic stories hide.

•Carry a notebook: Keep a notebook on hand to capture story ideas, moments of insight and snippets of conversation that could lead you to a story. Review it often.

•Look for patterns: Search for themes, experiences and events that repeat themselves. Patterns reveal stories that want to be told. 

•Talk to frontline staff: Chat with the people who interact directly with your customers like receptionists, call center staff or salespeople. They have a wealth of stories to share.

•Consider company values: Think about experiences that showcase your company values in action. How have employees or customers demonstrated those values? There are stories there.

The key is to explore every possible avenue to find stories within your business and the lives of your customers. While control is limited, authentic stories can be found when you make the effort to listen and observe. Finding real stories requires curiosity, patience and a dedication to understanding your true impact. But the result is a story with the power to resonate.

 

- The biggest barrier to telling your story is assuming you don’t have a story to tell. Everyone has stories, even if they are small. Stories come in all shapes and sizes, and there is a place for all of them. 

- Finding stories involves two processes: collecting and choosing. Collecting stories is about generating story ideas without judging them. It’s brainstorming using tools to avoid feeling intimidated by a blank page. Choosing stories involves determining which stories will work for your specific situation or audience.

- To collect stories, focus on the nouns in your life: people, places, things, and events. Make a list of these nouns, and allow memories associated with them to surface. Asking questions about these nouns will trigger more stories than asking broad questions. For example, ask about a specific place someone was stationed rather than their whole experience in the war. 

- An executive wanted to tell a story about innovation to convey that while it’s amazing, it can also be painful. But searching for a story without focus made it hard. Using the noun approach, focusing on people, places, things, and events related to innovation led to many story possibilities. The executive landed on the story of an innovative new policy that improved efficiency but was difficult for some long-term employees to adopt. The story achieved the goal of acknowledging the pain that can accompany innovation.

- In summary, don’t assume you have no stories. Collect stories by focusing on the nouns in your life and the memories associated with them. Then choose the right story for your specific situation. With practice, finding the right story will become second nature.

 

After struggling to find stories, the author and the man decided to focus on nouns related to the man’s life and experiences. They made lists of the technologies and innovations the man had witnessed, like music players, computers, and phones. Though they found potential stories related to many nouns, the story of the man’s first experience with his dad’s car phone stood out. 

The author explains that focusing on nouns, first experiences, customer questions, real-world examples of your message, and asking lots of questions are all good ways to find stories. She says the belief that you need an exciting life to have good stories is a lie; our lives are full of stories, we just don’t recognize them.

The author then moves on to choosing which stories to tell. She shares the story of Suzanne Cannon, who founded a company to help vet clinics offer payment plans after struggling to pay for emergency care for her sick dog. Suzanne used her story to connect with vets and pet owners on an emotional level. At first, her story was effective, but over time she found it wasn’t resonating as much. The author helped Suzanne find more stories to share to keep her message fresh.

The key points are:

•Focus on nouns, firsts, questions, examples, and your own life to find stories. Your life contains many stories, you just have to uncover them.

•Once you have stories, choose the ones that best fit your message and audience. Share different stories to keep things interesting. 

•Stories that illustrate a problem your business solves or a life experience you have in common with your audience are especially powerful. But varying the stories you share is also important to maintaining impact.

•Don’t believe the lie that you need an exciting or dramatic life to have good stories. Your everyday experiences likely contain many stories if you look for them.

- Suzanne and Tony launched VetBilling, a payment plan service for veterinarians and pet owners. Though they signed up many vets, they struggled to generate revenue because the vets were not actually using the service. 

- They realized they needed to get vets fully engaged in order to succeed. Their initial story about Suzanne's experience launching the company was compelling but didn't drive vets to use the service.

- They shifted to telling "value stories" that showed how VetBilling could help vets avoid having to turn away pet owners who couldn't afford care. This new strategy led to much greater success in getting vets to use and promote the service.

- Choosing the right story for your needs and audience is key. The four essential types of stories are:

1) Value stories: For sales and marketing 
2) Founder stories: To build confidence and differentiate 
3) Purpose stories: To align and engage teams
4) Customer stories: For sales, marketing, and credibility

- To choose a story, identify your objective and audience. See which type of story best serves both. Look for stories in your history that fit.

- Stories are happening all around us. We can find stories in current events and interactions to use as reminders or examples. Watching a story unfold in front of you is a great way to find stories.

 

• Start crafting your story with the explosion, the pivotal moment or event in the story. This is the part people will typically remember first when recalling a story. 

• Then go back and craft the normal, the details leading up to the explosion. This helps the audience understand the context and care about the characters. Use the story components— character, emotions, details, and familiarity—to draw the audience in.

• The new normal wraps up the story and often reinforces the message or lesson. End by coming full circle back to familiar details or events from the beginning. This provides closure for the audience.

• The normal → explosion → new normal framework, along with the four story components, provides a simple structure and checklist for crafting compelling stories. Anyone can use this process to create persuasive stories, even those who don’t consider themselves natural storytellers.

• Stories have power to captivate, influence, and transform. Crafting stories around your message or ideas is a skill that can benefit anyone in business or in life. With practice, you can get better at identifying stories and crafting them to achieve your objectives.

The key is simply to start. Look for those story scraps in your everyday life and work, choose one that fits your need, and begin crafting with the explosion. Let the story unfold from there using the framework and components as your guide. With practice, crafting compelling stories can become second nature.

 

In the beginning, you have the knowledge, wisdom and understanding that you did not have before. You now have the tools and ability to craft impactful stories. Like any skill, storytelling takes practice. Start with a simple framework of normal, explosion, new normal. Identify the key components: characters, emotion, details and moments. Tell your story and then refine and improve it over time based on feedback and experience. 

The best part is this method works. You don’t need gimmicks or tricks. A well-crafted story stands on its own. The length of a story depends on its purpose. It can be as short as an “elevator pitch” or as long as 90 minutes. The key is to start with the full story and then cut it back to the time you have. 

A 10-second story still needs key elements like normal, explosion, new normal, character, emotion, moment and details. A 3 to 7 minute story gives you time to develop the normal, draw the audience in, connect them emotionally and help them relate. If you do that, time won’t matter.

Some common pitfalls to avoid:

1. Not crafting the story specifically to support your goals. Know why you're telling the story and who your audience is.

2. Starting at the explosion. Context and relatability come from developing the normal first. 

3. Trying to be the hero. Focus on the transformation of the characters, not you.

4. Forcing details or emotions that don’t feel true or natural. Keep your story authentic.

5. Not practicing your story. Practice, get feedback and refine to make the most impact.

The key is simply to start. You now have the basic tools and understanding. With practice, your ability to craft stories will become second nature. Stories change lives, spread ideas and move people into action. Go tell your stories!

 

The author visits her sister-in-law at work and is introduced to her coworkers as “that storyteller.” One woman recognizes the author and says she loves a story from the author’s book about an experience in middle school. 

In sixth grade, the author struggled to fit in and make friends. She felt like an outsider. She was cast in a play at a neighboring high school, The Sound of Music, which gave her a sense of belonging. She became friends with the high school students in the play. For a few months, she felt happy and like herself again.

On the last night of the play, the author was invited to the cast party. Even though she was only 11, her parents let her go. At the party, they went on a hayride, ate snacks, and drank hot cocoa. 

The girl playing Louisa von Trapp, one of the author’s favorite characters, took her outside. Louisa told the author to get on her hands and knees in the grass. The author could see her breath in the cold air. Louisa told her to close her eyes and feel the earth in her hands. She told the author to imagine she was holding the earth.

The story shows how a small moment of connection and imagination during a difficult time can have a lasting impact. Though just a tiny story from her past, the author's experience of feeling like she belonged during the play stayed with her.

 

- The author suggests telling stories in presentations and offers several tips:

1. Start with a story. It helps ease tension, breaks down barriers between speaker and audience, and calms the speaker’s nerves. Telling a relatable story about a client or one’s own life puts the audience at ease and signals that they like the speaker. 

2. Use stories when a picture is not enough. A story can convey complexity and nuance that an image alone cannot. Stories give meaning and context. They help audiences understand concepts and ideas that are difficult to grasp otherwise.

3. Keep stories short. In presentations, stories should be 30-90 seconds. Keep them concise while still being impactful. Short stories are more captivating and easier for audiences to follow. 

4. Practice your stories. Rehearse them ahead of time. Know them well enough to tell them smoothly without reading from notes. Practice in front of a mirror or record yourself on video. Hearing yourself tell the story will make you more comfortable sharing it with an audience.

5. Make eye contact. Engage your audience by making eye contact as you tell the story. Look at specific members of the audience as you speak to make a personal connection and draw them in. 

6. Use vocal variety. Change your tone, speed, and volume to bring the story to life and keep the audience engaged. Pause for effect. Vocal variety and strategic pauses will make your story more dramatic and impactful.

The key message is that stories are extremely useful in presentations. When told well, they can capture attention, convey information, and ultimately lead to more successful presentations. With practice and the right techniques, stories become a powerful tool for any speaker.

 Here’s a summary:

• The author initially refused to use PowerPoint in presentations, claiming to be a storyteller. But he later realized the audience had trouble following his points without visual aids. 

• He now uses PowerPoint but warns that it must be done right. Some tips:

1) Leave space in the deck for stories. Use a slide as a signal to tell a story. 

2) Choose images for story slides wisely. Don’t rely on photos to tell the story. Let the audience imagine the story. Using photos can disrupt the audience’s imagination. 

3) Focus on the message, not perfect wording. Practice but don’t over-rehearse. Leave room for spontaneity. 

• In 2008, the author had a chance to tell stories at the National Storytelling Festival. He practiced constantly but realized he had over-rehearsed and “blew it.” Practice should make you prepared, not perfect. 

• Stories can be powerful in job interviews. A man used stories to land his dream job as a pilot, standing out from other applicants. 

• Only tell stories you’re comfortable sharing. The author used the story of a company called Soul Carrier as an example but was told by another speaker that such a personal story seemed exploitative. Choose stories that feel right to you.

• In summary, use visuals to aid storytelling but don’t rely on them. Practice your stories but avoid over-rehearsing. And share only what you’re comfortable with. Stories have power but must be wielded responsibly.

 

- The educator knew many inspiring stories of students from disadvantaged backgrounds who had succeeded. However, she didn't want to share these stories because they were confidential and she felt it would be unethical. Though she felt pressure to tell such dramatic stories, the author advised her to only share stories she felt comfortable sharing. 

- The author said that we often tell stories naturally when we're happiest and most comfortable. The problems with storytelling usually come from the teller "getting in the way of the story." When you have a meaningful story to share, the telling comes naturally. 

- The author shared an example of telling her son a simple story from her childhood about playing with fireflies at night. Though it had no real plot, her son loved the story and asked her to tell it repeatedly. The author realized that her son, like all humans, simply craves stories. Stories help us make sense of the world and find happiness.

- The author's son even asks for specific stories to help him understand new experiences, like getting his first splinter. The author realized that stories construct our lives and identities. Telling stories is not something we simply do—it's what we are.

- In conclusion, the author says that good storytellers tend to be more attractive and successful. Storytelling can help "close the gap" between where you are and where you want to be. She ends by reminding the reader that all stories start from something that really happened, even if they begin with "Once upon a time." Our lives are a treasure trove of stories waiting to be told.

 Here are summaries of the four scenarios:

Once upon a time, a failed marketing effort left you cashless, and then you had to rebuild, learn from your mistakes and try again. 

Once upon a time, you ran completely out of money, and then you had to make difficult decisions, cut costs and find a way to generate more revenue to stay in business.  

Once upon a time, a critical shipment was stuck in customs, and then you had to scramble to source materials elsewhere, delay projects and manage customer expectations.  

Once upon a time, you dreamed a dream about being in business, and then you faced obstacles and setbacks but persevered because you believed in your vision.

 Here is a summary of the key points from the book:

•There is power in storytelling to build connections and convey messages. Storytelling activates parts of the brain that encourage empathy and understanding. 

•Advertisers have long used powerful stories and emotions to sell products and build brands. Successful Super Bowl ads often rely on humor, nostalgia, and storytelling.

•The “value story” focuses on how a product or service improves customers’ lives. It shows the transformation and appeals to emotions. Successful brands like Apple are adept at telling value stories.

•The “founder story” shares details of how the company started. It highlights the mission, vision, and purpose that inspired the creation of the company. The story of Airbnb’s founding highlights its purpose and growth.

•The “purpose story” articulates why the company exists beyond making a profit. It gives employees and customers a sense of meaning and impact. Leaders who share purpose stories build trust and connection.

•The “customer story” shares true stories of how real customers have been impacted and transformed by a product or service. Customer stories and reviews build credibility and connection with new potential customers.

•To tell your story: Identify your key message, find stories that highlight that message, build a narrative arc, use vivid details, and drive the story towards a key point. Share your story with passion and authenticity.  

•Storytelling is a skill that can be developed and improved over time. Look for stories happening every day and practice telling them. Observe great storytellers and work to replicate what they do. Your storytelling ability will grow with regular practice and time.

In summary, storytelling is an essential skill for business leaders and brands. Stories create an emotional impact and forge deep connections. When used strategically, storytelling can be a powerful way to spread ideas, share purpose, build culture, and market products and services. With practice, anyone can become an effective storyteller.
