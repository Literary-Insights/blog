 Here is a summary:

- The passage discusses testing new business ideas and products through focus groups and market research before fully launching. This allows the business to gauge reactions, identify any necessary changes, and ensure the best design. 

- It recommends designing evaluations to address all stakeholder concerns. Testing should include promotional ideas, pricing, and value propositions at different stages of the design process.
