- The introduction describes magical moments when people feel like time stands still and they are totally immersed in the present moment, without thoughts of past, future or normal perceptions of time. 

- It suggests these experiences occur rarely but seem to transcend normal time, with people feeling connected to something larger than themselves. 

- The book aims to explore human perceptions of time from both scientific and experiential perspectives. It looks at how we experience and measure time internally versus external clocks and calendars.

- The discovery of biological clocks and temporal processing in the brain revealed we have an "inner time" that is distinct from public or external time. This inner experience of time can differ greatly from one moment to the next.

- The book aims to gain a deeper understanding of time to help people become "sovereign" over their experience of it and live more relaxed, focused lives in harmony with natural rhythms. It offers insights into how we can make better use of our "scarcest commodity".

So in summary, the introduction sets up the exploration of human time experience from scientific and experiential angles, with the goal of helping readers understand and better manage their personal experience of time.

 

- The passage talks about the different ways people experience and perceive time. While clocks show objective clock time, there is also subjective inner time that operates according to its own laws and perceptions. 

- Inner time can make unpleasant situations seem to drag on while happy moments fly by. It also plays a role in why life seems to speed up as we age. 

- Cultural factors influence how people perceive time. Some groups like the Aymara people see the past as in front of them rather than behind, reflecting their different attitudes toward the future.

- Our perception of time is shaped by both nature and nurture. It develops from the interaction between our environment, brain, experiences, and genetic makeup. 

- While clocks represent objective external time, our experience of time comes more from our internal consciousness and interpretation of events. This suggests we have more power than assumed to influence our subjective experience of time.

 Here is a summary of the key points from the passage:

- The passage explores Michel Siffre's experiment where he spent over 60 days in complete isolation and darkness in a cave to study how it would affect his sense of time. 

- Without external time cues like daylight, Siffre quickly lost his sense of time orientation. He greatly over- or under-estimated how much time had passed between activities. 

- Unknowingly to Siffre, his biological clock maintained a precise 24.5 hour schedule, alternating between 16 hours awake and sleeping. 

- When he was extracted from the cave after over 60 days, Siffre was shocked because in his mind he had only been there for around 25 days. A large portion of time was essentially "missing" from his conscious experience.

- The experiment demonstrated that our subjective experience of the passage of time is largely shaped by external cues and patterns, and can become distorted or lose meaning without them, even as the body's biological clock remains precise. It highlights how malleable and shaped by context our time perception really is.

 

- Michel Siffre conducted an experiment where he isolated himself in a cave for over two months without any indication of time, such as clocks or sunlight. He soon lost track of time and his circadian rhythm adjusted to around 25 hours. 

- Similar experiments were conducted at the Max Planck Institute where students isolated themselves for weeks at a time underground. They also adjusted to circadian rhythms longer than 24 hours. 

- These experiments revealed the existence of our biological clock, which regulates circadian rhythms and keeps the body tuned to roughly 24 hours. However, our sense of time is produced separately by our consciousness and can become detached from our biological clock. 

- Our biological clock is suited for regulating daily cycles like sleep, hormones, digestion etc. but is not designed for counting precise minutes and hours. That temporal awareness was a later cultural development as modern societies required more coordinated schedules. 

- The author notes individuals have different natural circadian rhythms, with some being "night owls" staying up later and some "early birds" preferring mornings. Our biological clocks instill these personal rhythms that are difficult to change.

 

- Our biological clock, determined by our genes, regulates many aspects of our daily rhythms like energy levels, mood, digestion, etc. It affects when we feel energetic versus drained. 

- Having a misaligned daily routine can lead to wasted energy, fatigue, and even health issues over time. Babies are often born and deaths occur most frequently around 4-5am.

- Early experiments in the 1700s showed that plants like mimosa still opened and closed their leaves on a daily cycle even in darkness, indicating an internal biological clock. 

- Even simple single-celled organisms like euglena migrate up and down on a daily rhythm in darkness, showing they have an internal biological clock in each cell.

- Modern research shows that within complex organisms, each of the trillions of cells contains a molecular clock mechanism involving gene expression in cycles lasting about 24 hours. 

- These cellular clocks need to be synchronized by a master clock, located in the hypothalamus for mammals. Damage to this central clock can disrupt daily rhythms. 

- Light resets the cellular clocks to keep them aligned with the day/night cycle through signals from the eyes. Our internal clock runs slightly faster than 24 hours if not adjusted by light.

 

- Light signals from the eyes activate the suprachiasmatic nucleus in the brain, which acts as the central circadian clock. This aligns the body's internal clock with the day/night cycle. 

- The light signals slow down or speed up the body's internal "chemical hourglass" rhythm. This keeps sleep patterns in sync with changing seasons and day length.

- Morning light sets the clock ahead, evening light sets it back, balancing the effects and keeping sleep periods around 8 hours long. 

- Individuals differ in their natural circadian rhythm, with some being "morning people" or "larks" and others being "night people" or "owls." Genetics play a role in determining one's circadian type.

- Throughout the day, hormones and neurotransmitters fluctuate in cycles, affecting mood, alertness, digestion, physical performance and other processes in a circadian pattern. Optimal times for different activities are outlined.

 

- The passage discusses how the body's circadian rhythm affects alertness, mood, temperature, and other factors at different times of the day and night. 

- Around 8-10pm, melatonin is secreted to prepare the body for sleep. Most people feel their alertness fading and mood dipping at this time. 

- Studies show that the majority of sexual intercourse occurs between 10pm-1am. 

- Teenagers are natural night owls, as their circadian rhythm makes them feel sleepy later than adults. Delaying school start times has been shown to improve teen achievement and attendance. 

- Living and working indoors without sufficient natural light exposure can disrupt the circadian rhythm and lead to issues like insomnia, depression, and poorer work performance. 

- Shift work that requires working at night against one's natural circadian rhythm has been linked to higher rates of insomnia, health problems, accidents, and lower productivity. Better lighting can help but not fully resolve the issues.

 

- A study was done at Volkswagen (VW) where workers filled out questionnaires about their natural day-night rhythms (whether they were "larks" who preferred early shifts or "owls" who preferred late shifts). 

- The company doctors could have assigned workers to shifts aligned with their natural rhythms on a long-term basis, but the workers feared losing access to more lucrative night shifts and opted to keep working against their biological clocks.

- Most people, including the VW workers, assume time is dictated by clocks rather than individual biological rhythms. But each person has their own internal rhythm.

- More recent research has shown that movement and physical activity can influence a person's perception of time. Athletes report experiencing "the zone" where time seems to slow down, enabling better performance. 

- The roots of our internal sense of time were unclear for over 150 years as scientists searched unsuccessfully for a central biological clock mechanism. They proposed theories like a clock in the ears, but these were not supported by evidence.

- Initial experiments showed how time perception can be overestimated or underestimated for short versus long intervals, providing insights into how our internal timing mechanisms may work even without an identified physical clock.

 

- Researchers have found that our sense of time is linked to our sense of movement and rhythmic patterns in the body. Areas of the brain like the cerebellum and basal ganglia, which control movement, are also involved in time perception. 

- Experiments using brain scanning technology show increased activity in these areas when subjects estimate durations of time.

- If our movement patterns are disrupted, like in people with injuries to these brain areas or with Parkinson's disease, it can distort one's sense of time. 

- Evolutionary, it was more efficient for the brain to link time perception to our internal movements and rhythms, rather than developing a dedicated timekeeping mechanism.

- Factors like how quickly or slowly one is moving, or observing the movements of others, can influence our perception of the passage of time. Time may seem longer or shorter depending on movement pace.

- Other brain areas like the supplementary motor areas help organize sequences of movements and events over longer time periods to help us distinguish durations.

So in summary, our sense of time is fundamentally tied to and derived from our sense of rhythmic movement patterns controlled by different areas of the brain. Disrupting these patterns can impact one's time perception.

 

The passage discusses Warren Meck's hypothesis that the brain measures time through the simultaneous oscillation of many pacemakers in the brain. When these pacemakers align, they create "chords" that correspond to specific time intervals. The brain uses these chords to recognize when periods of time, like a traffic light cycle, have elapsed. 

While this mechanism allows for quick recognition of familiar time intervals, it is difficult for people to consciously gauge exact durations in seconds. The passage explains that timing movements relies on automatic motor control areas of the brain, while longer periods require conscious attention and working memory. Damage to areas linking these timing mechanisms can distort time perception, as shown through a case study of a man whose sense of time sped up fivefold due to a brain tumor.

Overall, the passage analyzes hypotheses for how the brain measures and perceives time, from milliseconds to minutes, through interacting networks of neural pacemakers and memory systems across the brain.

 

- Alfred Hitchcock's film Rope manipulates perceptions of time by using long continuous shots with minimal cuts, making the movie feel much longer than its actual 80 minute runtime. 

- During a dinner party scene that lasts only 30 minutes in real time, the film conveys all the impressions and details one would experience over a longer 3 hour party. This demonstrates how easily human time perception can be distorted.

- Our sense of how time passes depends greatly on our state of mind - time flies when we're enjoying ourselves but crawls when uncomfortable. However, this elasticity usually works against our wishes. 

- While we perceive very brief intervals precisely, our sense of longer intervals like minutes and hours is notoriously unreliable, even for experiences we're very familiar with. The chapter will explore how the brain tries to make sense of time over longer durations in the absence of an internal clock.

 

The brain goes to great lengths to estimate time durations, but it often misleads us in the process. It uses environmental cues like how long things are in our field of vision. But when our attention is focused elsewhere or we are under stress, time seems longer or shorter than it actually is. Events that grab our attention will seem longer, while distracted activities make time fly by as we aren't paying attention to the brain's time signals. Stress, caffeine, and focusing on a specific task can all cause us to underestimate how long periods of time last. So while the brain has ways to perceive time, our subjective experience of duration is highly malleable based on our emotional and cognitive states.

 Here is a summary of the provided excerpt:

- The passage discusses the concept of moments, which are the small fragments of time that make up our lives. However, the definition of a "moment" can vary considerably in terms of duration. 

- Moments are like the individual tiles or stones that make up a mosaic - when viewed up close you see the distinct pieces, but from far away they blend together into a continuous picture. 

- Our present experiences are constantly transitioning into the past as future moments arrive. The boundary between present, past and future occurs at the infinitely thin "line" of the present moment. 

- Just how brief can a moment last? Scientific measurements show the human senses require at least 1/10 of a second to register visual changes, but some cameras can capture motion within 1/2000th of a second. The passage questions whether even shorter durations could constitute a moment.

- In summary, the excerpt explores the concept of moments as the microscopic building blocks of time that make up our lives, but notes there is ambiguity around how briefly a "moment" can last.

 

- Theologians have long debated what constitutes a "moment" and whether Jesus' resurrection could have happened instantly. Some concluded the smallest unit of time is an "atom of time."

- Modern physicists have measured time intervals many orders of magnitude smaller, down to attoseconds. But the theoretical Planck time is even smaller, around 10-43 seconds. 

- In biology, the limits are longer due to how neurons transmit signals. Humans perceive events separated by at least 1/100 of a second as distinct. We can distinguish sounds separated by 1/10,000 of a second through differences in ear arrival times.

- Vision works more slowly, requiring around 1/10 of a second between images to perceive them separately. 

- This means our experience of the present depends on our senses. The visual present lasts longer than the acoustic present. This could cause chaotic experiences if we focused on different senses at once, like watching a track meet on TV. Overall, the passage examines how our perception and experience of time has both physical and biological limitations.

 

- The brain corrects for minor discrepancies between our senses, like hearing and sight, by delaying faster information to synchronize everything we perceive as happening simultaneously. 

- Our conscious perception of events lag behind actual reactions. When responding to an external stimulus, the brain sends movement commands before we are consciously aware of the stimulus. 

- In experiments where subjects freely choose to make a movement like snapping fingers, brain activity preparing for the movement occurs before subjects are consciously aware of deciding to move. 

- Experiments introducing brief delays between actions and their effects can make people feel like they are seeing into the future as their perception adjusts to compensate for the delay. 

- The brain shifts the timing of our actions and their effects in our memory so we perceive them as closer together, allowing us to recognize their connection and feel our actions have immediate impact. This contributes to our sense of free will.

- Through these processes, our perception of "now" integrates events separated by over a second of time, making us unable to detect discrepancies between our internal sense of time and objective external time.

 

- The human brain has difficulty focusing on the present moment and is constantly drifting into thoughts about the past, future or irrelevant matters. Even during pleasant experiences like concerts or relaxing on the beach, our minds wander. 

- Experiments have shown that people's attention shifts away from the current task, on average, over 40 times in a half hour period. When reading novels like War and Peace, people often daydream and fail to comprehend or retain details despite their eyes moving across the page. 

- When the mind is not engaged externally, it tends to turn inward and get caught up in unproductive daydreams, internal monologues, and anxiety. The brain activity lacks purpose or meaning when not focused on experiences in the present. 

- Many philosophers and spiritual teachers throughout history have emphasized the importance of being fully present, mindful and engaged with each moment as it occurs. However, it is challenging for the human mind to avoid drifting away from direct experiences and focusing excessively on the past, future or trivial thoughts.

 

- Psychologist Russell Hurlburt studied people's thoughts using a random signal device and found their thoughts were often quite mundane and trivial, like repetitive phrases or worrying about minor details. 

- Our conscious attention drifts when nothing important demands it, as a way to conserve mental resources. Attention operates unconsciously on an alert-orient-focus system to detect relevant stimuli. 

- Complete focus on the present moment only happens when a task fully engages our perception and mental abilities, striking the right balance of challenge. Psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi studied such "flow" experiences. 

- Flow occurs when a task fully utilizes our brain's optimal information density, allowing other thoughts to fade away. It can happen during various activities from work to hobbies, not just work itself, enabling moments of deep presence.

 

- H.M. is a man who lacks memory due to a 1953 surgery that removed parts of his brain involved in forming memories. Over 100 scientists have studied him. 

- H.M. lives fully in the present moment, with no connection to his past experiences or ability to conceive of the future. He does not remember people, conversations, or anything that happened more than a minute ago.  

- Despite having no memory, H.M. maintains good social skills and manners. He is self-aware of his condition and can joke about forgetting things immediately. 

- For most people, experiences flow together like a film. But for H.M., each moment is disconnected from the next, like separate photos with no connection. He provides a unique case study of what life would be like without the ability to remember the past or envision the future.

 

- H.M. had parts of his brain surgically removed to treat epilepsy, including the hippocampus. This left him with no ability to form new memories or experience time passage. 

- For H.M., each new moment was like waking from a dream with no connection to what came before. He had no sense of time intervals beyond 20 seconds.

- The case revealed different types of memory: implicit/procedural memory remained intact, allowing skills like mirror reading, but explicit/episodic memory was lost, preventing experiences from being stored.

- Memories transition from short-term working memory to long-term storage by engaging us intensely or repeatedly. The hippocampus codes and consolidates experiences for long-term memory storage across the brain. 

- Recalling memories involves reconstructing scattered details in convergence zones. The basal forebrain helps arrange memories chronologically. 

- H.M.'s condition provided insights into how memory and the experience of time originate in the brain.

 

- Memory transforms us over time as past experiences shape our personality. When we remember something, the specific neural pattern associated with that experience is stored in the brain. 

- For a memory to be retained long-term, the brain has to alter the structure of neurons by growing new dendrites and pathways between neurons. This physically imprints memories in the brain. 

- Unlike a computer, the brain itself is both the "hardware" and "software" - memories change the physical structure of neurons, which in turn determines our feelings and behavior. 

- Losing memory of past experiences, as in the case of the man injured in a motorcycle accident, means losing one's sense of personal history and orientation in time. Small autobiographical details help situate memories in time. 

- Our memory of dates and durations is weak without external aids. We have little innate ability to time-stamp memories with precise temporal data.

 

- When it comes to recalling details of past events like accidents, "Where?" and "Who?" are often more helpful indications than "When?". Knowing exact dates does not usually aid memory retrieval. 

- Flashbulb memories of momentous events like 9/11 tend to be more vividly recalled due to emotional arousal and repeated exposure through media coverage. 

- Memories are not static recordings but rather are reconstructed each time they are recalled. Our current emotions and perspectives can influence which details we retrieve and how we interpret them. 

- Over time, many memory details fade while others are strengthened through repeated recollection. Our memory of past events continues to be restructured for years. 

- We have some ability to consciously reshape our emotional reactions to past events and modify how we interpret their meaning. Prefrontal brain regions can help regulate amygdala-driven negative emotions associated with memories. 

- Memories are dynamic rather than fixed, with details falling away or becoming integrated into new networks through continual reconstruction over long periods. Our sense of the past transforms as our memory evolves.

 

- The Piazza Navona in Rome is a famous circular Baroque square located in the historical center of the city. 

- The bleachers of the small Marcello Theater, located near the Piazza Navona, were converted into apartments after the decline of the Roman Empire, as building materials from the past were often reused and reassembled into new structures.

- Throughout history, each period has reused and transformed building materials from earlier eras into new buildings, which were then later renovated or demolished as times changed.

- When recalling our own memories, we play the role of architect in how we reconstruct and assemble our recollections of past experiences and times in our lives. Memory does not operate linearly but can compress or expand our sense of the passage of time.

 

- The passage discusses how our perception and memory of time changes as we age. As time passes, intervals in the distant past seem shorter than they actually were. 

- Marcel Proust was intrigued by the idea that there are two types of time - measurable clock time and subjective "duration" experienced through consciousness and memory. He wrote his novel "In Search of Lost Time" to try to revive memories from the past and bring lost time back to life. 

- The development of a sense of time in humans begins at a very young age. Infants can recognize small differences in rhythms and sounds. Around age 1.5, children develop the ability to understand concepts like "earlier" and "later". 

- Between ages 4-7, children begin to store continuous memories and grasp the order and sequence of daily events. The brain is very active in forming memories during this period. 

- Our memories from ages 4-20 tend to stay most vivid, according to the "reminiscence effect". As we age, it becomes harder to form new memories and integrate them into our dense network of existing memories and experiences.

 

- Proust's novel reserves his most vivid descriptions for the narrator's childhood surroundings like the white briars along family strolls and the church tower in Combray. 

- Young children under 5 cannot accurately gauge or reproduce time intervals of more than a few seconds. Elementary school children have a rough idea of minutes but the present is still predominant in their perception of time. 

- Piaget found that children often make errors in grasping concepts like "earlier" and "later" until around age 13 when puberty begins. 

- Adolescents begin to understand concepts like a whole lifespan but time perception fluctuates greatly due to hormonal and brain changes during puberty. 

- In adulthood, time seems to accelerate as years pass due to having fewer novel memories formed and retained over time as the brain ages. The ability to recall youth fades more slowly due to formative early experiences.

 

- The passage discusses how the pace of modern life has continually sped up over time, from Goethe's commentary in the 1820s to the present day. 

- It notes how forms of travel, communication, and daily activities have accelerated dramatically. For example, letters now arrive via email instantly versus taking weeks, and coffee breaks are rushed versus lingering. 

- Watching older movies reveals how perceptions of time have changed, as rapid cuts from the 1960s that once pushed limits now seem slow. 

- This constant acceleration of pace and increase in speed is seen as a major trigger of stress by many. While innovations aim to make things faster, it also adds anxiety to daily life.

- The passage uses Goethe's comments from over 200 years ago to show this phenomenon of feeling overwhelmed by speed is not new, though modern technologies have ramped up the pace to an unprecedented degree.

 Here is a two-minute summary:

As our lives speed up, our perception of pace follows suit. A scene from the 1960s TV show Space Patrol took too long for modern audiences, so producers greatly accelerated the speed when releasing it as a movie in 2003. Surveys show people increasingly feel pressed for time - in the early 2000s, 35% of Germans and 30% of Americans often felt rushed, up from 25% and 21% a decade prior. 

This faster pace is linked to worse health and more stress. Yet paradoxically, we have more actual free time than ever before due to reduced work hours and home labor. The real issues aren't a lack of time or external speed but three internal "time wasters" - an inability to focus, feelings of being overwhelmed, and lack of motivation. While our perception of time has accelerated, others see time as more generous and community-focused than we do in Western culture.

 

- Industrial society is based on workers selling their time for an hourly wage and requires strict adherence to schedules like train/work times. Without strict timekeeping via clocks, this kind of system would not function effectively. 

- The proliferation of clocks in society represented more than just a technological advance - it had wide-ranging cultural implications by not meshing well with human nature. 

- In the early 20th century, school textbooks began emphasizing the value of timekeeping and punctuality. Watch companies advertised their products as teaching "practicality, promptness, and precision." 

- American society came to equate living by the clock with success, and watches became status symbols. However, some warned that an overemphasis on punctuality could lead to issues like "neurasthenia" or exhaustion from working too rapidly. 

- The proliferation of clocks and emphasis on punctuality first took hold in industrialized Western nations but later spread globally as countries like Japan industrialized in the postwar period. Today's hyperconnected world means even remote areas experience influences like Western pop culture. 

- Once a certain fast pace of life becomes normalized in a society or group, it is difficult to slow down as individuals feel compelled to keep up with others' speeds. Experimental evidence shows people will unconsciously increase their work pace in groups to match others.

- Our modern media-saturated world bombards us with more stimuli than past eras could conceive of, but we have adapted to always be seeking more entertainment and diversion. What was once a memorable county fair is now readily available television content we barely notice.

 

The brain struggles to process the huge amount of information it receives. It has two main ways of coping - jumping quickly between stimuli without focusing on any one thing fully, or being selective about what information it pays attention to. Neither approach is ideal. 

Craving constant stimulation and new information is hardwired into our brains from an evolutionary perspective, as noticing changes in the environment could signal important threats or opportunities. However, in modern society this constant bombardment of stimuli via screens and devices prevents us from concentrating fully on tasks. Our attention filters become porous and we lose the ability to focus sustained attention. 

We feel addicted to the constant arousal and flow of new information, even though it leaves us unable to concentrate. Our days become a blur of constant switching between tasks rather than focused work. While the constant stimulation feels good in the moment, we are often left with an empty feeling, as we cannot recall what we actually accomplished with all that time. Modern culture also frames idleness or having free time as something to be avoided at all costs through keeping busy.

 

- The passage discusses how difficult it is to stay focused and manage one's time effectively. Time management tips and strategies from self-help books often don't work long-term since they fail to address underlying issues. 

- A major contributing factor to feelings of time pressure is an inability to concentrate. The passage examines why concentration is difficult and how the brain normally functions to help us smoothly juggle tasks.

- The human brain has an "executive function" that allows it to formulate plans, keep important information in working memory, highlight primary tasks, and calculate options. This helps guide us smoothly through daily life under normal circumstances. 

- However, the executive function has limitations. When people feel overwhelmed, their thoughts jump between problems and they lose a sense of direction. An inability to focus on the task at hand is a core reason why time feels insufficient.

- Simple lists and schedules alone do not account for the unpredictable changes that occur. Staying concentrated amid fluctuations requires mental agility supported by the brain's filter and cost-benefit analysis abilities.

 

The working memory has a limited capacity, being able to hold only around 7 pieces of information at a time. Trying to juggle too many tasks leads to confusion and things slipping through the cracks. Multitasking is inefficient because the mind can only focus on one thing at a time - it has to switch back and forth between tasks rapidly. Each switch requires mental energy and time as the working memory has to reload information. Interruptions are disruptive as they derail the train of thought. It takes effort for the executive function to refocus on the original task after an interruption. Multitasking and frequent interruptions cause productivity to plummet as attention is fragmented. It is better to focus completely on one task at a time before switching to the next to avoid losing time and information during the context switching process. Stray thoughts also provide internal distractions, making it hard to stay on task without discipline from the executive function.

 

- Specific regions of the prefrontal cortex responsible for executive function develop slowly in children. This makes it difficult for young children to delay gratification in pursuit of greater future rewards. 

- Three factors affect executive function: ability to concentrate, stress level, and motivation. Chapters will examine each in detail. 

- The sushi chef has highly developed executive function, allowing focused concentration despite distractions. This stems from mechanisms in the brainstem and midbrain that release neurotransmitters like norepinephrine and dopamine.

- Small amounts of caffeine from coffee can temporarily improve executive function for some by stimulating these neurotransmitter systems. However, it is not a long-term solution. 

- People with attention deficit disorder have weaker executive function, making it hard to focus and delay gratification. Experiments show computer games can help train executive function even in adults, improving brain activity in prefrontal cortex regions. Things like sudoku and card games may also help with concentration.

 

- The chapter criticizes common time management advice to simply make lists of tasks without providing guidance on effectively working through the lists. 

- It introduces a three-step program developed by Harvard psychologist Steven Safren to more efficiently manage time: 1) Make a task list, 2) Break down each task into smaller, more manageable stages and substages, 3) When an unrelated thought arises, write it down and return to the original task without getting distracted. 

- The third step of exercising self-control is emphasized as being most important. It enhances the brain's executive function through practice, similar to cognitive behavioral therapy. With practice, people can recognize and cope with distractions to focus longer. 

- The chapter closes by noting that with regular practice, self-control can become routine and automatic, freeing up mental resources like experienced drivers no longer needing reminders of basic tasks.

 

- The original study claiming that "Type A" personality and hurried lifestyles led to early death and heart problems was found to be flawed and not representative of the general population. Smoking was a major confounding factor among the study patients. 

- Subsequent larger studies found no link between managerial roles and increased heart attacks. The "Type A" theory proved to be a myth.

- Stress comes more from a feeling of lack of control over one's situation and time, rather than from actual time pressures. Studies show those with less control in their jobs (lower ranks) experienced more stress and health issues. 

- Having some ability to control stressful events, even through placebos like a fake button, reduces stress responses. A sense of helplessness is what triggers the stress reaction. 

- Controlling others' time through requiring meetings or interruptions is a display of power that subordinates experience as stressful loss of control over their own time.

 

- Many people feel that their constant connectivity to devices like cell phones and the internet has taken away their autonomy and freedom, making them constantly available to others. 

- Having young children at home also contributes to feeling rushed and lacking control over one's schedule, as parents have to respond immediately to children's needs which fragments their routine. 

- However, the stress we feel depends more on our perceptions than external circumstances. Studies show women tend to feel more pressed for time even when they have equal responsibilities as men.

- What we associate certain events with, like anticipated vulnerabilities, impacts our stress levels more than objective measures of time. The anxiety of losing control is often masked as a lack of time. 

- People's feelings of having enough time or being rushed varies greatly based on individual perspectives. Things seen as obligations by some are viewed as leisure by others. Time pressure is more subjective than objective.

 

The extent to which working parents feel in control of their time largely depends on societal and workplace norms and expectations, rather than individual choice. Even when offered maximum flexibility at work, few parents in the study took advantage of reduced hours or flexible schedules. This was not due to lack of company support, but rather a sense of obligation to prioritize work over family or personal time. Socially and culturally, work is often seen as more worthwhile and less stressful than parenting responsibilities. So working parents may feel pressed for time at home yet unwilling to trade work hours or pay for more free time, due to internal and external motivations valuing careers and income over flexible schedules. Feelings of being in control of one's time are influenced more by societal conditioning than actual options available.

 

- Employees at Amerco (a company) spent long hours at work and had little incentive to spend time with family. The workplace had become a refuge from stresses at home like nagging spouses and children. 

- Working long hours created more chores and demands at home, motivating employees to work even longer hours to cope. They had created their own "time bind."

- While employees had freedom over their time, they failed to use it well and it took them a while to recognize their role in the situation. 

- People often say we should invest time like money, but this is hard because the brain is constantly looking for appealing alternatives and rewards. Projects tend only to get done when they have to be done. 

- Anticipating future rewards through "somatic markers" can motivate people toward long-term goals, overcoming impulses for immediate gratification. But short-term reward systems may also keep focus. 

- For Amerco employees, wanting fulfilled family relationships conflicted with choices that prioritized short-term work dinners over family time when faced concretely.

 

- Time seems to constantly pass by as days turn into nights and seasons change, but some philosophers have questioned if time is really passing or if it's just an illusion due to our limited perspective. 

- In the 17th century, Christiaan Huygens developed an accurate pendulum clock that could measure time within 10 seconds per day. This breakthrough captured time in a way that had not been possible before. 

- However, his stationary clock could not be used where accuracy was needed most - on ships for navigation. Ships needed a portable chronometer that would keep accurate time at sea.

- In 1714, two English clockmakers, George Graham and John Harrison, took on the challenge of creating a marine chronometer that could keep precise time while enduring the vibrations and temperature changes of ocean voyages. This breakthrough enabled accurate global navigation and transportation by sea.

- Their success demonstrated that time could be precisely measured through mechanical clocks, challenging the idea that time was some intangible phenomenon outside human control. It helped shift views of the world as a machine-like system that could be understood through science and technology.

 

- Isaac Newton proposed the idea of absolute time - that there must be a universal clock that regulates the flow of time in the universe. He saw tangible clocks on Earth as a reflection of this cosmic clock. 

- Newton's ideas came to dominate thinking about time. However, his concept of absolute time could not be proven since there was no way to directly measure a cosmic clock.

- It took over 200 years for Albert Einstein to revive the ideas of Gottfried Leibniz, who argued against absolute time. Einstein resolved issues in physics by introducing the theory of relativity. 

- One of Einstein's insights was that the speed of light is constant in all reference frames. This challenged Newtonian physics and the idea that speeds can simply be added or subtracted. Einstein established that the flow of time is relative and mutable depending on motion and perspective.

So in summary, Newton proposed a cosmic clock regulating absolute time, while Einstein's relativity dismissed this in favor of time being relative based on the constant speed of light in all reference frames. Einstein established the modern understanding of time which discounts Newton's concept of absolute time.

 

- According to Einstein's theory of relativity, there is no universal or objective frame of reference for time. Time passes at different rates for observers in different frames of motion. 

- In a thought experiment, Thelma is moving in a rocket ship past Louise on Earth. Louise would see Thelma's clock ticking slower than her own due to time dilation from relative motion. 

- Experiments like Joseph Hafele's clock-flying experiment around the world have verified these relativistic time dilation effects for observers in motion. Moving clocks are measured to run slower than stationary ones.

- Einstein's initial special theory of relativity held that time and space are relative only to the observer's frame of reference. His general theory later accounted for how objects with mass also warp spacetime in their vicinity. 

- Higher gravitational potentials (further from massive objects) experience faster elapsed time than strong gravitational fields closer to massive objects like the Earth, so clocks run slower closer to massive bodies. This too has been experimentally verified.

 

- Einstein's theory of general relativity showed that gravity can alter the passage of time. Large masses like the Earth slow down the flow of time. 

- Two people, Thelma at the bottom of a tower and Louise at the top, try to measure time using light beams. Louise sees Thelma's light as redshifted and oscillating more slowly, so from Louise's perspective, time is passing more slowly for Thelma. 

- Gravity's effect on time comes from objects being closer or farther from the massive center of the Earth. All massive objects warp spacetime and slow the passage of time. 

- Time itself is relative - there is no single, universal time. But observers can agree on whether two events can influence each other (if light could travel between them) and on the sequence of cause and effect between events. Causality gives time its directionality from past to future.

- While general relativity allows time reversal theoretically, in practice most processes like a shattered teacup cannot be reversed due to increasing disorder over time.

 

- The scenario of a tennis ball bouncing follows Newtonian/Einsteinian physics well because only two bodies are involved - the ball and gravity. This allows us to imagine time as reversible for simple systems. 

- When a teacup breaks, it is less straightforward because many small pieces and interactions are now involved (tea splashing, sugar dissolving). This increased complexity leads to more entropy or disorder. 

- Entropy makes sense as a concept only when dealing with large numbers of objects. A broken teacup has higher entropy than an intact one. 

- According to the 2nd law of thermodynamics, entropy never decreases in a closed system. So the broken teacup scenario cannot reverse as it would require reducing entropy. 

- Time's arrow is closely linked to increasing entropy. The past has lower entropy than the present or future. Reversing time would mean decreasing entropy, contradicting the 2nd law. 

- At the smallest scales nearing the Planck time, the concepts of space, time, and causality break down, calling into question notions of time's irreversibility. Physics may need reimagining without time at the most fundamental level.

 

- The passage discusses the concept of Diaspar, an imagined futuristic city from a science fiction novel where time has been abolished through advanced technology. People in Diaspar live essentially immortal lives without aging, birth, death, or change. 

- While having unlimited time seems appealing, the passage argues life in Diaspar would actually lack meaning, emotion, growth and change. Deep experiences like love, memory and anticipation require the passage of time.

- It suggests true fulfillment comes not from quantifying and accumulating more time as a commodity, but from making prudent choices about how to use the time we have meaningfully. 

- A "new culture of time" is needed that moves away from an abstract clock-driven concept of time and establishes a suitable individual and social rhythm in line with human perception and experience of time. 

- Six steps are outlined for this new culture, focused on easing stress, protecting family time, being fully present, variety and challenges, quiet reflection, and flexible planning.

 Here is a summary of the six steps outlined in the passage:

1. The first step is about gaining sovereignty over one's time and taking control of how time is used rather than being a slave to external demands and schedules. This brings more control and reduces stress. 

2. The second step highlights the importance of living in harmony with one's biological clock or natural body rhythms. This enhances well-being and efficiency. 

3. The third step is about cultivating leisure time and relaxation to achieve balance. This involves creating unscheduled blocks of time and slowing down the pace of life.

4. The fourth step is focused on conscious perception of the present moment rather than dwelling on the past or future. This expands one's experience of time.

5. The fifth step aims to improve the ability to focus on activities and stay attentive in the present. 

6. The sixth and final step calls for setting priorities and taking an active role in shaping one's available time rather than feeling like a victim of external circumstances.

The overarching theme is that one can gain more influence over time by taking control of it rather than being controlled by clocks and schedules. Living intentionally in accordance with one's natural rhythms enhances quality of life.

 Here is a summary of the key points from over-272:

- The passage discusses the ephemeral nature of things like cherry blossoms in Japan which only bloom for a short period. It contrasts this with the more durable nature of older buildings that are seen as more esteemed over time. 

- It talks about improving focus and concentration by only focusing on one task at a time, as the mind cannot truly multitask. Frequent interruptions actually prolong the time it takes to complete tasks. 

- Stress can also derail our executive function and make us feel there is less time, when really the stress is preventing us from being efficient. Simple exercises like listing tasks and goals can improve focus.

- We must examine our priorities and decide if things really need to be done immediately or if consequences of delaying are acceptable. This reduces stress and feelings of being rushed. 

- It discusses how our experience of time is dependent on our circumstances and level of concentration. Time itself may not be a fundamental part of reality. 

- A new culture of time is proposed with less obsession over rigid clocks and more individual pacing and flexibility. Time should be seen as a resource rather than a constraint.

- Squire and Kandel 1999 - Provided an overview of memory formation and retrieval in the brain. 

- Wagenaar 1986 - Demonstrated failures of temporal memory through a diary study.

 

- A researcher tried to determine if people could recall the temporal order of unrelated events from their daily lives. Out of 314 attempts, he was able to correctly recall the order just 22 times. Most of those recalled events occurred in the same location. He could only remember the order of 2 events based on their timing alone, which may have been due to luck. 

- The brain seems to primarily store temporal connections between events that are meaningfully related or interconnected. Unrelated events like something in the morning and evening are not usually grouped together just by their timing on the same day, unless recalling them the very next day. Chronological details fade quickly from memory. 

- People can recall events from the previous week by thinking of a specific day, while details are still fresh. But those details fade from memory over time as well. 

- In general, it is difficult for people to recall the temporal order of unrelated daily events based solely on their timing. Meaningful connections or contextual details seem to be needed for events to be temporally grouped together in memory.

 Here are the key points summarized from the passages:

- Friedman and Rosenman (1959) proposed the concept of Type A personality characterized by impatience, competitiveness, aggression, and time urgency. They linked it to increased risk of cardiovascular disease. 

- However, their study was flawed as it did not properly control for smoking and other confounding factors. The diagnostic criteria were also flawed. 

- More recent research shows that moderate stress and time pressure can enhance prefrontal cortex function and cognitive performance, but high stress impairs it. There is an inverted-U relationship.

- Chronic stress from low social status, lack of control, and unstable/demanding work is linked to health problems like cardiovascular disease. 

- Having some constraints and demands on time can enhance productivity, but too many constraints leads to distress and lack of fulfillment. Unemployment also deprives people of a sense of time structure and purpose. 

- Time scarcity is increasingly common and linked to longer work hours, responsibilities, and multitasking. This constant time pressure threatens well-being and productivity. 

- We have an insatiable desire for more time and consumption that is hard-wired, so breaking free requires conscious effort to change habits and priorities.

 

- Thelma observes light traveling between two mirrors from her perspective. The light takes the shortest path between the mirrors. 

- She measures the time this takes as t'. 

- The distances traveled form a right triangle. 

- Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can write an equation relating the time t' Thelma measures to the actual time t and the velocity v of the mirrors:

c^2t^2 = c^2t'^2 + v^2t^2

Where c is the speed of light and v is the velocity of the mirrors. 

- This equation accounts for the differences in time measurements due to Thelma and the light beam experiencing different frame of references, one in motion relative to the other, as described by Einstein's theory of relativity.

 Here is a summary of the key points from the articles:

- Toplak et al. (2005) examined executive and motivational processes in adolescents with attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). They found that adolescents with ADHD showed deficits in planning, decision-making, response inhibition, and motivation compared to controls. 

- Torelli et al. (1999) investigated factors associated with weekend headaches. They found that lifestyle and work factors, such as overcommitting free time and workload, were associated with increased risk of headaches over the weekend.

- Tse et al. (2004) studied how attention affects perception of time. They found that attending to a stimulus caused it to seem like it lasted longer, due to increased processing of the stimulus. Divided attention reduced this effect.

- Tulving (2002) discussed "chronesthesia," the conscious awareness of subjective time and the ability to mentally travel in subjective time. He reviewed studies on autobiographical memory and how we represent time mentally.

- Turek et al. (2005) found that circadian clock gene mutations in mice caused obesity and metabolic disorders resembling aspects of human metabolic syndrome. This suggested a link between circadian rhythms and metabolism.

 Here is a summary of the key points about time perception in the brain from the passage:

- The brain uses various gauges to perceive the passage of time, including rhythms of breathing, changes in surroundings, comparable past situations, and imagined or real movements. 

- Parts of the brain like the cerebellum, hippocampus, and frontal lobes are involved in time perception. The frontal lobes in particular influence our perception of minutes and hours.

- Factors like arousal level, sleep deprivation, distractions, drugs/caffeine can influence how the brain perceives time. Higher arousal can make time seem faster.

- The brain has to compensate for processing delays, so our consciousness of events lags slightly behind actual time. This helps explain why consequences can feel like they were anticipated.

- Children and populations with brain injuries may have different perceptions of time than adults due to brain development factors. The assessment of long periods of time also develops with age.

- Overall, many aspects of the brain work together to allow us to perceive the continuous flowing of time, though this perception can be subjective and influenced by our mental state.

 Here is a summary of the key points about time and stress from the provided index:

- Stress is linked to increased perception of time pressure and feeling rushed. Factors like lack of control, pace set by others, and time constraints can all contribute to stress. 

- Physiologically, stress is associated with increased levels of hormones like cortisol and norepinephrine. Prolonged stress can lead to health issues over time. 

- Countries and cultures with more industrialized, fast-paced societies tend to experience higher overall stress levels. Job hierarchies can also be a source of stress as people aim to move up the ranks. 

- Managing a home and family on top of a demanding job is a major source of stress, especially for working parents. Lack of control over one's schedule contributes to stress. 

- Technology may paradoxically increase stress by adding to time pressures and expectations of being constantly connected. Managers tend to experience high stress levels due to responsibilities of their roles. 

- Prolonged and intense stress can negatively impact health over the long-run if not managed properly. Finding ways to relax and reduce stress levels is important for well-being.

 This passage summarizes various topics related to time, stress, and memory:

- Stress hormones like noradrenaline are important for attention, reversing decline in the brain, and the stress reaction. 

- Animals experience stress and stress reactions similar to humans. 

- ADD, anxiety, exercise, and executive function are related to stress. 

- Stress can be combated through control over time, degree of control, easing stress, focus on the present moment, listening skills, and avoiding "weekend headaches."

- Perpetual stress leads to hormones that damage memory. 

- Stroke can impact memory. 

- Time management, focus, listening skills, and avoiding stress can help manage time pressures. 

- The "weekend headache" phenomenon is related to stress. 

- Memory and working memory are impacted by stress levels. 

So in summary, it discusses the physiology of stress, how stress impacts attention, memory, and the brain, and some strategies for managing stress and time pressures.
