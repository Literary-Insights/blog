- Chrome extensions allow users to customize and enhance their browsing experience on Google Chrome. They can be built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and a manifest.json configuration file.

- ChatGPT can help non-developers create their first Chrome extension by providing step-by-step instructions and code examples without any programming required. 

- Common files needed are manifest.json to configure the extension and content_script.js to modify webpage content.

- Extensions can be uploaded to the Chrome Web Store to be installed by other users.

- Popular monetization methods for extensions include advertising, in-app purchases for premium features, paid upgrades, lead generation and affiliate marketing. 

- Identifying a target user market and problem/need helps determine the optimal monetization approach for maximizing revenue from the extension. 

So in summary, ChatGPT can help anyone build a basic Chrome extension, and with proper monetization like paid features or ads, extensions have potential to generate ongoing income from users on the Chrome Web Store.

 Here is a summary of key points about using Chrome extensions to generate leads and build a customer base:

- Chrome extensions can be used to streamline sales outreach by providing email templates and automating follow-up reminders. This helps effectively generate leads. 

- Affiliate marketing is another option, earning commissions by promoting other companies' products through banners or ads on your extension. Users are directed to advertiser pages and you receive a cut of resulting sales. 

- Monetization without uploading to the Google Chrome Web Store can be done by giving away the extension in a funnel that requires an email capture. This allows collecting leads without submitting to the app store.

- ChatGPT can assist with various aspects like coding support, but the focus should be on the idea, features, design, testing and marketing of the extension. 

- Revenue potential varies widely depending on factors like quality, value and monetization strategy. Dedication is needed to build a successful income stream.

- Combining ChatGPT's capabilities with existing marketing methods can help maximize revenue generation from a Chrome extension.
