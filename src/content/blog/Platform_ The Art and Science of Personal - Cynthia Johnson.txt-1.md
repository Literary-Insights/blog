- Cynthia Johnson introduces herself as a recognized digital marketing and personal branding professional with a large social media following. However, she acknowledges she is not an expert on everything. 

- She cautions against people positioning themselves as experts on topics they don't fully understand, as she has done herself. This can spread misinformation. 

- She argues real experts need platforms to share their knowledge and counteract false narratives. Expertise should be built on reputation and experience.

- Johnson credits her career opportunities to creating and strategically managing her personal brand. She provides her story not to boast but to show anyone can do it with focus.  

- Personal branding is accessible to all and necessary today. If you don't manage your brand, others will do it for you. 

- Developing your brand requires strategy, including your brand message, auditing yourself, setting goals, and managing growth. You must take it as seriously as corporate branding.

- Your online presence as part of your personal brand can impact your life as AI grows. Manage your brand to shape how you are perceived.

 Here are the key points summarizing the strategies for effective personal branding:

- Personal branding is about self-awareness and self-preservation, not just promotion. Manage your brand like you would your credit score.

- Everyone has a personal brand in the digital age. The choice is whether to actively manage it or not. 

- Brands strive to connect with people, but people naturally have a voice and ability to connect. Don't try to be a brand, let brands try to be more like you.

- Branding historically evolved from identifying products to connecting ideals and emotions. Now brands connect us to lifestyles and self-expression. 

- We quickly associate with brands to signal who we are and where we belong. Choose brands strategically to shape your image.

- Control your personal brand narrative by proactively managing your online presence and reputation. Address flaws and build your brand intentionally.

- Develop your brand through experience over time, like building credit history. Ask for help from others in building your brand, but earn it first.

- Set up alerts to monitor your brand. Define your brand strategy and direction. Execute plans to achieve your brand goals.

 

- We choose brands, products, and services that align with our identity and the people we want to be associated with. Contradictions arise because we trust brands selectively based on our values.

- Brands try to evoke emotional connections like people do naturally. Personal branding is really about owning your authentic self, not packaging yourself to sell. 

- To be heard, understand your own value and which audiences will listen. Don't mold yourself to be someone else.

- Public relations was rebranded from propaganda to manage perceptions. PR and news aim to influence audiences and spread agendas, not be fully objective.

- Personal branding takes time. Listen to your instincts and don't force yourself into being "the next" anyone else. Stay true to your unique self.

 

- Edward Bernays was an early pioneer of public relations who worked for major companies like American Tobacco. He famously got women to smoke cigarettes in public by framing it as an act of women's liberation. 

- Bernays combined his uncle Sigmund Freud's theories of psychology with ideas about crowd behavior to develop the concept of public relations. 

- The key to influence is understanding your audience and what motivates them, not thinking about yourself. You need others like the media to spread your message.

- Personal branding is about making yourself authentic, not just trying to imitate brands. Brands strive to be more human, while humans should focus on accurately communicating who they are. 

- Ivy Lee was an influential early PR practitioner hired by the Rockefellers after the violent Ludlow Massacre associated with their coal mining business. 

- Lee helped the Rockefellers rehabilitate their reputation through PR tactics after they were seen as responsible for the deaths of workers striking for better conditions.

- The Ludlow Massacre and subsequent PR response was an early example of reputation management and damage control.

 

- The Rockefellers were widely criticized for the deaths of coal miners during a mining accident. Under the guidance of publicist Ivy Lee, they started a PR campaign to repair their reputation by humanizing themselves. 

- The Rockefellers met with coal miners, hosted events, inspected working conditions, and listened to families of the deceased. This drew media attention for being unheard of at the time. 

- Lee advised the Rockefellers to put their name on buildings and associate themselves with more than just wealth. He knew personal branding was key to changing public perception.

- Communicating and relating to your audience is essential for building a positive personal brand. The Rockefellers won sympathy by showing up and listening, despite poor business practices that led to deaths.

- Sheryl Sandberg has spoken against personal branding, but brands represent values and personal branding is about authenticity, not packaging yourself. She may not realize she has a brand since hers developed circumstantially.

- Princess Diana challenged norms and stigma by visiting an AIDS ward and shaking hands with a patient without gloves. She used her reputation for good and took control of her brand.

- Personal branding is about freedom from influence, not gaining influence over others. Diana listened deeply and understood the impact of her actions.

- Listening more than speaking, thinking for yourself, and questioning accepted norms creates opportunities for positive change and shapes your authentic brand.

 

- Pennies cost more to produce than they are worth, yet billions are still made each year. The US spent $137 million to make $81 million in pennies in 2014. 

- In 1975, Gary Dahl sold 1.5 million Pet Rocks for $4 each, profiting $3 per rock and becoming a millionaire. In 2016, Nordstrom's sold leather-wrapped rocks for $65-$85 that sold out. 

- Apples can take up to a year to reach grocery stores, losing much of their nutrition in storage. Our assumptions about apples keeping doctors away may be wrong. 

- When things we assume have value actually do not, it shows that anything is possible. We need to think for ourselves, challenge norms, and define our own metrics for success.

- Knowing what you don't want is the first step to figuring out what you do want. Eliminate things that don't serve you.

- Be obsessively passionate and authentic to yourself. Your life and work should align with your values.

- Recognize quickly when a situation isn't right for you, and move on. Don't sacrifice your happiness.

- Define your own metrics for success rather than society's. Achievements only have the value you give them.

 Here are the key points from the passage:

- The author used to define what she wanted in life as simply "freedom" - the freedom to do whatever she wanted. She thought acting and film would provide that freedom, but found they didn't.

- She went through many different jobs and quit many of them, slowly building up a list of things she didn't want in her life and career. This process helped her narrow down what she really wanted.

- She learned not to make assumptions about what other people were thinking. Instead, she started asking for what she wanted directly. This opened up many surprising opportunities. 

- The passage uses the airplane oxygen mask analogy to illustrate the importance of taking care of yourself first before helping others. You have to secure your own mask first in order to be able to help others. 

- The key message is not to assume you know what others are thinking. Ask directly for what you want in life. Be willing to say "no" to things you don't want to make room for what you do want. Take care of your own needs first. This process helps clarify your true passions and opens up new possibilities.

 

- The story describes an experiment where a robot named Destin is able to perform tasks accurately until he is deprived of oxygen, at which point his cognitive abilities deteriorate rapidly. Once given oxygen again, he returns to normal within seconds. 

- The point is that it is difficult to help others if you are not taking care of your own needs first. Just as Destin couldn't function without oxygen, it is easier to make others happy if you are happy yourself, and easier to make connections for others if you are well-connected yourself.  

- Personal branding involves crafting your own story and résumé. Leonardo da Vinci wrote one of the first known résumés, showcasing his skills and personality. Your online presence serves as a résumé today.

- Résumés have evolved over time from handwritten documents to digital profiles. An effective résumé tells a story about your abilities and gives a glimpse of your personality beyond just career facts.

- The key is to showcase your skills and solution-oriented thinking, while also conveying your unique interests and personality. This helps build a personal brand that attracts opportunities.

 Here are the key points about managing your online presence:

- Résumés have evolved from paper to digital as technology has advanced. Your online presence is like an abstract or summary of your life. 

- Do an audit of what information exists about you online, including social media accounts, reviews you've left, old blogs, etc. Make a list of what you do and don't want associated with you.

- Research yourself thoroughly using search engines and aggregation sites to find as much as possible about your online brand.

- Update your ad preferences on sites like Amazon, Facebook, and Google to remove unwanted categories and information associated with you. 

- Have someone else search for you to see what they can find - if it makes you nervous, keep cleaning up your online presence.

- Identify unremovable negative content and make a plan to suppress it with new positive content. Control your narrative by emphasizing what you want known about you.

- Continuously monitor your online presence and tweak as needed to align with your goals. Think carefully before posting anything new that could impact your brand.

 

- Build your personal brand by establishing an online presence through social media, blogging, websites, and interacting in relevant online communities. Address any negative content about yourself honestly. Research people before meeting them. 

- There are four main elements of a personal brand:

1. Personal Proof - Education, experience, credentials, achievements that give you confidence. Recognize why these matter to you.

2. Social Proof - Who you know, what they think of you. This is very important. 

3. Association - Align yourself with reputable people/organizations. 

4. Recognition - Your reputation, being known for something positive. 

- Personal proof like college degrees matters more for your own confidence than to others. Focus on building connections. 

- The author realized high-level executives cared more about connections than formal education. Crashing MBA classes was a good way to learn without enrolling. 

- Timing and experience matter. Build your brand through real-world experience vs formal education if you can.

 

- The author was advised not to pursue an MBA and instead find a strong COO, do his own thing, and leverage current opportunities. This opened his eyes to an exciting future. 

- He became a guest lecturer at top schools, proving personal success without an MBA. He believes people's opinions are worth more than an MBA. 

- Social proof like followers, publications, speaking engagements establishes your qualifications. Network with people at your desired status.

- Ask for opportunities persistently until you hear "yes." The author emailed editors and got published in major outlets quickly. 

- Volunteer strategically to gain expertise, associations, and proof of abilities. One good connection can transform your network.

- Recognition like awards and rankings boosts your personal brand. But some may become less valuable as you grow. Leverage opportunities for recognition.

- Associate with influential people and organizations to gain credibility. Carefully consider all associations that shape perception of your brand.

 

- Winning an award in high school for Best Actress was a proud accomplishment, but it is no longer relevant to who I am now and what I hope to achieve going forward. Past accomplishments can't define you forever. 

- Awards given out for political or profit reasons may not have much meaning. It's important to focus on recognition from people who truly know and care about you.

- A strong personal brand statement encapsulates your values and vision. It serves as a guiding mantra for your goals and actions. 

- Good examples of effective brand statements are presidential campaign slogans, which communicate the candidate's mission and plan. 

- An ideal personal brand statement is short, clear, actionable, and reflects who you are and what you aim to accomplish. 

- The statement doesn't have to be totally unique - it just needs to resonate with you and guide your storytelling and decision-making.

- My personal brand statement is: "Build a Platform for Change"

 Here is a summary of key points for developing a personal brand statement:

- Identify your niche and what you want to be known for as a thought leader. Research others in your field and how you can differentiate.

- Determine your target audience and why they should care about your brand. Craft messages that would resonate with them. 

- Develop a consistent brand voice that aligns with your personality - whether serious, funny, relatable etc. 

- Curate your online presence and social media to convey your desired story and image. Remove anything that doesn't align.

- Claim your name on major platforms. Purchase a .com domain with your name if possible. 

- Build a professional website to anchor your brand. Use templates if needed, but customize to be distinctive.

- Develop content and share your expertise to build authority and grow your audience. Leverage online resources for telling better stories.

- Be patient and persistent in building an authoritative brand and community over time. It requires consistent effort.

The key is crafting a unique yet authentic brand that serves your niche audience and establishes you as a thought leader in your field.

 Here are the key points from the text:

- Build your own website (cynthialive.com/platform) or hire a developer to make a custom WordPress site. Include an About page, Press/Media page, Contact page, and "Invite Me to Speak" or "Hire Me to Speak" page.

- Create a media kit with headshot, short bio, and full bio. Have a few presentation outlines ready to send. 

- Gain personal proof through education (online courses), networking events, conversations with people in your desired field, relocating, internships, setting and achieving goals. 

- Take improv classes, speech writing, NLP to build skills.

- Find mentorships, workshops, opportunities to practice skills with low stakes. 

- Social proof comes from unexpected opportunities - say yes even if unprepared. Build association through clubs and organizations.

- Options: Meetup, Eventbrite, AMA, EO, Forbes Councils, Ivy, Millennium Alliance, Vistage.

The key is to build your credentials and network, gain hands-on experience even when unprepared, and leverage organizations to make connections. Be ready to showcase your abilities.

 

- In 1942, the U.S. government became concerned about the spread of harmful rumors about World War 2 and created the Office of Wartime Information (OWI) to try to combat them. 

- The OWI planned to set up "rumor clinics" at universities to study and report on media and news. However, they were unable to work well with social scientists who wanted to conduct their own research.

- Psychologists Robert Knapp and Gordon Allport launched their own rumor clinic in Boston in partnership with the Boston Herald newspaper. 

- After the war, Allport and Postman published research defining rumors as unverified propositions passed by word-of-mouth that meet emotional needs. 

- Their research found rumors spread through word-of-mouth, are amplified by media attention, and spread faster when responding to emotional needs. Characteristics like public vs private content and emotional reactions also affect how far rumors spread.

 Here is a summary of the key points about rumors and personal branding:

- Rumors can be categorized as impossible dreams, fear-based "ghost" rumors, relationship-ruining, and positive. Negative rumors spread faster than positive ones.

- Rumor mills start rumors through misinformation and lack of formal information. Social networks magnify the spread, not individuals. 

- What you don't say online is as important as what you do say. Sharing only certain content about yourself leaves less room for misinterpretation.

- When false expertise spreads online, real experts should reach out to correct the record and establish themselves as credible sources. 

- To build an authoritative personal brand, take yourself seriously, evoke authority, and provide details. Use peripheral cues like apparent expertise and many arguments to increase credibility.

- Be clear in online communication to avoid misinterpretation. Add indicators like :) to show tone. Monitor your brand and correct misinformation.

The key is to establish yourself as a credible expert to combat rumors and misinformation that could damage your personal brand.

 Here are the key points from the subreddit r/poeslawinaction on examples of Poe's Law:

- Poe's Law states that without a clear indicator of an author's intent, it is impossible to tell the difference between extremism and parody of extremism online. 

- Many posts on the subreddit document examples where it is unclear if content is serious extremism or satire/parody mocking extremist views. This ambiguity demonstrates Poe's Law.

- Some common examples involve posts about controversial political, religious, or social issues where an extreme/absurd view is expressed but it is unclear if it is meant seriously or satirically. 

- Other posts highlight cases where satirical content was mistaken as sincere by readers unfamiliar with the source/author's intent, showing how Poe's Law makes it hard to discern intent online.

- Overall, the subreddit collects instances that illustrate how easy it is for parody/satire to be misinterpreted as real extremism online and vice versa due to the difficulty in conveying tone on the internet. This highlights the broader issue Poe's Law addresses.

 

- You tried to book an Airbnb rental for a birthday party, but it turned out to be a scam website impersonating Airbnb. You lost money and had to scramble to find a real rental at the last minute. 

- When you returned from extended travel abroad, you moved into an apartment in LA with roommates, but one was bizarre so you left after a week. 

- You were laid off around your 26th birthday. A high school friend got you an interview at his company in Santa Monica, but the commute from your Pasadena apartment was terrible. 

- You strategically emailed LA Volkswagen dealerships until you got the exact car deal you wanted - $0 down and $199/month for a 2012 black Jetta. 

- After an accident, you convinced the dealer to replace your car with a new lease since it would be cheaper than repairing the damage. 

The key lessons are: don't fall for scams online, trust your intuition about people, be persistent in negotiations, and use all resources available to get what you want. Your perception of your situation kept you resilient through job loss and other challenges.

 

- I was able to get great deals on cars by negotiating solely via email. This allowed me to remove personal bias and emotion from the negotiation. 

- When negotiating in person the second time, the dealer's perception was that I would negotiate aggressively again, so he skipped negotiations to save time. My established negotiation reputation worked in my favor.

- Understanding how you are perceived by others is key. There can be differences between how you see yourself, how close connections see you, and how strangers see you online. 

- Asking family/friends for descriptive feedback on your personality reveals how you are perceived offline. 

- Research shows computers can judge personality traits from online activity as accurately as people who know you well. You can take online tests to see how your online persona is perceived.

- If you want to achieve certain goals, you can compare yourself to others successful in that area and adjust your online presence accordingly, like tailoring a resume. This isn't inauthentic - it shows you understand what's expected.

- Taking online personality tests can help reveal how your online persona is perceived and allow you to recalibrate if needed to achieve your rebranding goals.

 Here are a few key points about the passage:

- The passage provides a detailed description of the INTJ personality type, including their tendency to be independent, analytical thinkers who prefer working alone. 

- It then shifts to discussing issues around perception vs reality, using student evaluations of professors as an example. It notes biases that can influence perceptions.

- Next, it talks about imposter syndrome and how high achievers often downplay their own abilities and success. It provides tips for combatting this.

- Then the passage takes a dramatic turn, with the author suggesting we may be living in a computer simulation or "Matrix." This section does not seem directly related to the earlier parts about personality types and perception. 

- The author cites various "evidence" that we could be in a simulation, including comments from a NASA scientist and a report from Bank of America. 

- The passage ends abruptly, leaving it unclear if the author really believes we are in a simulation or if this section is intended to illustrate how easily perceptions can be manipulated. Overall, the passage covers some interesting topics but lacks coherence in its structure.

 

- The simulation hypothesis suggests we may be living in an advanced computer simulation like The Matrix. Figures like Elon Musk have given credibility to this idea.

- Sources perceived as credible, even if stating outrageous ideas, can shift mindsets and spread rumors. For example, if Bank of America suggested we live in a simulation, people would be more likely to consider it despite the claim's improbability. 

- Effective communication and branding can distract from the truth. It's about making people feel a certain way, not about facts. 

- Elon Musk is a prime example of someone using personal branding to influence corporations and culture. His tweets alone can sway Tesla's stock price.

- After the Trump travel ban, Uber faced more criticism than Tesla/Elon Musk despite similar ties to Trump. Travis Kalanick quickly distanced himself while Elon Musk did not. This shows the power of personal branding.

 Here is a summary of the key events contrasting Elon Musk's and Travis Kalanick's responses during difficult times for their companies:

- In January 2017, Trump issued a travel ban targeting several Muslim-majority countries. Uber was criticized for surge pricing during protests, and Kalanick's reactive response was to create a legal defense fund. Musk proactively stepped down from Trump's advisory council. 

- In February 2017, Susan Fowler published a blog post alleging sexual harassment and misogyny at Uber. Kalanick reacted by launching an investigation. In contrast, a female engineer sued Tesla for harassment in 2016, but Musk did not face the same backlash.

- In February 2017, a video went viral of Kalanick arguing with an Uber driver about fares. He reacted by apologizing. Musk did not face similar scandals. 

- In June 2017, Kalanick took a leave of absence and later resigned as Uber CEO due to scandals and shareholder pressure. Musk emerged relatively unscathed from Tesla's challenges like production issues and lawsuits.

- Musk took a more proactive stance by engaging with the public on issues while Kalanick was viewed as reactive and failing to address root concerns. Their personal brands and reputations headed in opposite directions during this difficult period.

 

- Travis Kalanick of Uber and Elon Musk of Tesla responded very differently to recent controversies. Kalanick appeared reactive and inconsistent, while Musk was more proactive and aligned with his brand image as someone trying to "save the world."

- With the travel ban, Kalanick quit Trump's council due to backlash while Musk stayed on to create change from within. Musk positioned himself as an advocate. 

- With allegations of a sexist culture, Kalanick's response focused on "I" and Uber, while Tesla's response was more unifying by mentioning "our employees." 

- When confronted about mistreating a driver, Kalanick later apologized by admitting mistakes. Musk responded to factory injury concerns by pledging to meet with each injured employee. 

- Their brand personas influenced public perception. Musk acting "to save the world" led people to forgive missteps, while Kalanick appeared disconnected and untrustworthy.

- The key difference is that Musk built a consistent brand that aligned with his actions, while Kalanick did not. Their personal brands shaped how the public perceived their companies' responses to crises.

 Here is a summary of the key points about game theory:

- Game theory analyzes competitive situations involving multiple players where the outcome depends on the actions of the other players. It uses mathematical models to predict outcomes. 

- Noncooperative game theory deals with situations where players act independently. The goal is to predict the other players' actions to get the best outcome for yourself. A classic example is the prisoner's dilemma. 

- Cooperative game theory involves players working together towards a common goal. The Shapley value is used to determine fair allocation of rewards based on each player's contribution. 

- Key concepts in cooperative game theory include marginal contribution, interchangeable players, contributing nothing means receiving nothing, and cost/payment based on time worked.

- Game theory can provide insights into real-world situations like economics, politics, and business negotiations by modeling the strategic decision-making involved. The goal is to find mutually beneficial outcomes.

 

- The author used game theory and informational social influence to grow a large following on Twitter. 

- They identified trust signals like reliability, feedback, and credibility as important for gaining followers.

- They researched where their target audience was concentrated geographically. 

- They started a weekly Twitter chat using a branded hashtag to engage with followers and influencers in the field.

- Responding to everyone who participated helped build community and increase followers. 

- Over time this strategy positioned the author as an authority on digital marketing and helped them gain over 1 million followers.

- The tips like starting a Twitter chat and focusing on trust signals can help others build their personal brand and following on social media.

 Here is a summary of the key points about business-to-business marketing:

- The author was named one of the top 100 most influential marketers in 2017, ranking high in categories like social media, video, writing, influencer marketing, marketing agencies, and content strategy. 

- The author grew their following and notoriety through understanding algorithms, building community, and providing value to followers. 

- Game theory concepts like signaling value and mechanism design were used to strategically gain followers on Twitter.

- Algorithms were reverse-engineered to determine which accounts to follow that would signal credibility and likely lead to follows back. 

- The author suggests not trying to seem "famous" on social media but rather focusing on connecting with people and providing value.

- The concept of six degrees of separation indicates most people are highly interconnected, so strategic following is a good way to reach a target audience.

In summary, the author achieved influencer status through strategic use of game theory, algorithms, and community-building to grow their audience and provide value. The focus was on genuine connection versus appearing popular.

 

The article discusses how interconnected everyone is through social media and other online networks. It references the "six degrees of separation" concept - that anyone in the world can be connected to anyone else through a chain of acquaintances that has no more than five intermediaries. 

On Twitter, research found that the average number of connections between any two users is around 5. This means you are only about five Twitter "friendships" away from connecting with anyone else on the platform. 

The article gives tips for effectively networking and growing your audience on Twitter. It emphasizes understanding the algorithms and finding creative ways to connect that aren't just following the prescribed methods. Knowing the rules deeply allows you to sometimes break them and be rewarded by the system. 

An example is shared of strategically tweeting at the Los Angeles Dodgers' Twitter account during a baseball game in order to get them to follow the author back. This involved playfully leveraging the author's brother who was trash talking the Dodgers. 

The key takeaway is that online conversations are always a "three-way" between you, the other person, and the technology/platform mediating the interaction. You have to account for how the technology impacts the networking in order to build relationships effectively.

 

- The world is more connected today, and people are busier as a result. We need to justify our time spent and be more strategic in networking. 

- There are benefits to thinking of social media platforms as a third party in networking conversations. The algorithms can provide useful insights to help us connect more effectively.

- To utilize social media tools, understand what the platforms and their algorithms want - money, users, safety, competitive edge. 

- Review the many ways to connect on each platform and match those to your networking needs and goals. Be strategic over time.

- Have clear objectives when devising a networking plan. Make the other person aware of you before directly reaching out. 

- Use a multi-day strategy across platforms to put yourself in front of someone. Go from viewing profiles, to engaging with content, to connecting. 

- The goal is always to take the conversation offline to remove the algorithm middleman and develop a real relationship.

- Consider inbox fatigue - target people where they aren't overwhelmed with messages. Personalized outreach works better than cold contacts.

 

- When connecting with someone online, focus on your goals for each step of the process rather than just going through motions. Figure out how you can help the other person.

- Include your email and a note about how people can connect with you in your social media profiles. This makes it easy for others to reach out. 

- Quality over quantity - don't post too frequently on social media. Stick to sharing valuable content. 

- Avoid overusing hashtags - they should be used purposefully to create groups/discussions rather than tagging random words.

- Connect with influential people where you have the most leverage - like finding executives on Twitter where there is less noise. 

- Treat everyone equally - you never know who people will become. Be responsive even if you're busy.

- Remember that helping others also helps you expand your network, like the example of the Buzzfeed CEO.

The key is to be strategic and thoughtful in how you connect with and help others online to build mutually beneficial relationships.

 

- The 1% Rule states that only 1% of people online create content, while 99% are lurkers. This means a small minority shape the information landscape. 

- Wiio's Laws explain how communication is prone to failure and misinterpretation. Overcommunication, clear communication, and confirming understanding are important.

- The Streisand Effect means that trying to censor information online often backfires and draws more attention to it. 

- Segal's Law states that having multiple conflicting opinions publicly makes you appear unsure. 

- Cunningham's Law says that posting an incorrect answer gets you the right one through corrections.

- Skitt's Law means errors are likely when correcting others, especially if embarrassing. Don't take yourself too seriously. 

- The Law of Exclamation says too many exclamations undermine credibility of claims.

- Umhoefer's Rule states that articles on writing are often poorly written. 

- The author sought a LinkedIn mentor to improve leadership and communication skills. Despite being very accomplished, Mark Goulston was highly responsive and agreed to mentor.

 

- The author spoke at her first conference in 2014 on a topic she had researched (Pinterest and SEO). She was nervous but determined to prove herself amongst industry experts. 

- The night before, a man implied she was there just to "look pretty", fueling her motivation. 

- She convinced SlideShare to feature her presentation, causing it to go viral. This launched her speaking career with many invitations.

- A year later at the same conference, a woman said the author's previous presentation had changed her life. This affirmed her legitimacy. 

- The author didn't play by the same rules as others, but taking extra steps to promote her content made a big difference. 

- The story illustrates the importance of putting your work in front of people rather than assuming it will stand out on its own. A year later, the author was contacted by a NY literary agency.

In summary, the author worked hard to promote herself, took risks to stand out, and it paid off by launching her career and leading to new opportunities. The key is getting your work seen.

 

- The author was asked to write a book because her SlideShare presentations had a large following. This led her to write about personal branding. 

- The inverse approach to personal branding means thinking differently than the norm. Common assumptions about self-promotion are stated, along with their inverse perspectives. 

- To get noticed, spend time where your target audience wants to be, not just where they are. Ask them what content they want.

- You can download your LinkedIn contacts to see who knows you. Use this list strategically, not to spam people. Stay top of mind. 

- The author embraced a new work persona as "the social media girl" with quirky clothes and giant glasses. This led to her ideas being noticed and career growth. 

- Overall, the inverse approach involves questioning assumptions and using creative strategies to get noticed by your target audience.

 

- The author became popular on a live-streaming social network by appearing confident and aloof. When the network shut down, she had already established herself as a social media expert named "The Social Media Girl." 

- She dressed distinctively with fake glasses to stand out and attract social media work. She shifted her personal brand from "social media girl" to "digital marketing strategist" by changing her online presence and writing about new topics.

- To promote her new brand, she targeted her existing contacts with ads linking to her new marketing-focused content. This made her seem ubiquitous and top of mind in digital marketing.

- Being top of mind is critical when job seeking. An experiment by Robert Coombs showed robots filter resumes before humans see them, favoring keywords over compelling writing. 

- Referrals dramatically improve chances of getting hired. You need contacts at companies to refer you so your resume gets proper human review. Simply applying through systems is usually futile.

- The key lessons are to establish a strong personal brand in your field, nurture professional relationships and contacts, and stay visible and top of mind with your network. This leads to referrals, visibility, and job opportunities.

 

- Referrals fill the vast majority (85%) of critical job openings in the U.S., meaning only 15% are left for non-referred applicants. Competition is extremely high for advertised openings.

- Most jobs (70-80%) are not published or advertised. networking and getting employee referrals is critical. 

- Social media is used more by recruiters to find potential candidates rather than advertise openings. Optimizing your online profiles and networks is key.

- Staying top of mind with recruiters and their networks, even through targeted social media use, is important to get opportunities. 

- You can face resistance from close friends/family as you grow your personal brand. Breaking familiarity boundaries is necessary. 

- Some people will dislike you no matter what. Don't let it stop you. Kill haters with kindness.

- Having a public brand opens you up to criticism. But don't let fear of negativity stop you from pursuing your goals.

 

- Sarah Breedlove, known as Madame C.J. Walker, was the first female self-made millionaire in America. At her death in 1919, she was worth $600,000, equivalent to about $8 million today. 

- She was born in 1867 to former slaves and orphaned at age 7. With no formal education, she worked as a laundress earning under $1 a day. She married at 14 to escape abuse.

- Suffering from hair loss herself, Breedlove started selling hair care products for another company. She eventually created her own superior formula and launched her business in 1905.

- She employed and trained thousands of African American women as sales agents and to run their own beauty salons. Her company became very successful.

- Walker was also a noted philanthropist, donating to black institutions and causes. She advocated politically and socially for the black community. 

- She built her business despite the obstacles for African American women at the time, when they had very limited rights. She is considered one of the most successful female entrepreneurs ever.

- Her story serves as an inspiration, showing that success is possible through perseverance and drive even in the face of great hardship or discrimination. She is a role model for women entrepreneurs.
