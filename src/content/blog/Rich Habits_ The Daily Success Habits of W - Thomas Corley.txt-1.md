Herb Riser was a top car salesman who finally got the chance to buy his own dealership. Initially sales were slow, but Herb was confident they would pick up. However, he struggled with the responsibilities of being an owner and his sales remained lackluster. 

Eventually, Herb realized his dealership was failing. He did not know how to tell his family, who were expecting him home for dinner as normal. Herb sat outside on the porch, dreading going inside to break the news. 

When he finally told his wife, she was devastated, worried about paying the mortgage and bills. The next day, Herb went to work but avoided his staff, who sensed something was wrong. He got no answers from calls to his banker.
