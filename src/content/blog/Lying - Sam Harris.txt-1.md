 Here is a summary of the Table of Contents for the book "Lying" by Sam Harris:

The book is divided into 12 chapters that examine different aspects of lying and honesty. It begins by defining what constitutes a lie and discussing various forms of deception that are not technically lies. It then explores the psychological and social costs of lying, even small "white lies." 

The chapters are:

- What Is a Lie? - Defines lying and distinguishes it from other deceptive acts

- The Mirror of Honesty - Discusses research on lying in relationships and how honesty fosters trust 

- Two Types of Lies - Covers white lies and more serious/malicious lies 

- White Lies - Focuses specifically on smaller lies told to spare feelings

- Trust - Explains how lying undermines trust between people

- Faint Praise - Looks at insincere or exaggerated praise 

- Secrets - Examines the role of secrets in relationships

- Lies in Extremis - Analyzes lying in extreme situations like protecting others

- Mental Accounting - Looks at how people rationalize and justify their lies

- Integrity - Discusses cultivating honesty and integrity 

- Big Lies - Covers large-scale lies and their societal impacts

- Conclusion - Wraps up the overall arguments made in the book

The book ends with acknowledgments and information about the author's other works.

 Here are the key points:

- Telling the truth, even small "white lies", helps build integrity, authenticity and mutual understanding in relationships. It avoids unintended harm that could come from lies, even well-intentioned ones. 

- White lies deny people access to reality and can lead them to make decisions based on inaccurate information. This infringes on their freedom and ability to solve problems.

- Avoiding white lies requires paying attention to what is actually said rather than assumed subtext. It may reveal uncomfortable truths but allows for honest guidance and growth. 

- In situations like commenting on someone's appearance, it's better to speak the truth with care and compassion than shade the truth or lie to spare discomfort in the moment. Honest feedback could help the person improve their health and self-image.

- While truth-telling may occasionally come across as rude or maladroit, clarifying one's intent allows the relationship to stay open and improves understanding over lying or allowing false impressions. Integrity and candor are more valuable in the long run.

In summary, committing to honesty even in small matters builds trust and understanding in relationships, while lies – even well-intended white lies – can unintentionally mislead or harm people by denying them an accurate view of reality. Speaking the hard truths with empathy and care for the other person is preferable.

 Here is a summary:

- Lying to reassure a friend about their appearance is not helpful, as it prevents them from making changes that could lead to fulfillment. 

- Similarly, falsely encouraging a friend who is unsuccessfully pursuing a career like acting is a disservice, as it wastes their time and energy instead of prompting a change in path. 

- While honesty may be difficult, lying denies friends useful information and sets them up for disappointment. Yet the temptation to lie can be strong in such situations. 

- When we lie to protect others' feelings, we are arrogantly positioning ourselves as the sole judge of what they can handle about their own lives. This disrespects their autonomy and agency. 

- Stories are shared of relatives kept in the dark about medical diagnoses through deception, which denied opportunities for deeper familial support and understanding during difficult times. 

- Tiny lies still undermine trust and social dynamics, as when a friend was overheard lying casually to get out of plans, making the listener now doubt future cancellations. 

- Children have no compunction about exposing parental lies, as when one daughter contradicted her father's denial of objecting to houseguests, leaving him socially embarrassed.

- Insincere praise is not helpful and treats others like children, failing to prepare them for honest evaluations from others not invested in their feelings. Frank feedback, while difficult, can prevent wasted efforts and point to needed changes.

 Here is a summary:

- Being honest with friends, even if it means giving criticism, builds real trust and shows you respect their talents. When you praise their work later, they'll know it's sincere. 

- Keeping secrets for others can be difficult and potentially force you to lie or reveal private information. It's best to avoid agreeing to keep secrets unless required for your job. 

- In the example given, a woman's friend struggled with whether to tell her that her husband was having an affair, as everyone else seemed to know but her. Remaining silent felt like lying. Their friendship deteriorated as a result. 

- Lying should generally be avoided, but may be considered necessary in extreme cases to prevent violence, like protecting an innocent person from a known murderer. Even then, lying has downsides and honesty may still be attempted through direct confrontation. 

- In the customs anecdote, the author was honest about past drug use when asked, finding it led to a more positive interaction than lying would have. Honesty often facilitates better understanding between people.

 Here is a summary of the essay:

The essay discusses the psychological costs and consequences of lying. It argues that lying is mentally taxing, as liars must keep track of their false statements and ensure their stories remain consistent. This requires work and mental effort that detracts from authentic communication. Lies also breed distrust, as liars must monitor conversations for details that may contradict their fabrications. 

The essay then examines the concept of integrity and how lying violates it. People often lie to conceal behaviors they know will face disapproval, yet this deception often backfires and leads to greater shame and humiliation when the truth emerges. Several high-profile cases are cited as examples. 

It also discusses how "big lies" told by governments and institutions have eroded public trust in authority figures on many issues. Events like the Iraq War and vaccine skepticism are linked to acts of deception. These large-scale lies make it difficult to disseminate truth even after exposures. 

In conclusion, the essay argues that lies undermine relationships and autonomy by presenting a false vision of reality. They haunt liars going forward and can proliferate unreasonable doubts in societies. Most personal and societal harms require dishonesty as an additional moral failing, so truthfulness is presented as an ethical imperative.

 Here is a summary of the provided text:

- The essay discusses the harm that lies can cause to relationships, trust in institutions, and society overall. Lies spread misinformation and toxicity like a "social equivalent of toxic waste."

- It considers how one's relationships and life might change if they resolved never to lie again. Truths may come to light and one's character may be strengthened. Their honesty could also positively influence those around them. 

- The author is grateful for editorial help on the essay from his wife Annaka Harris, whose idea the topic was. His mother also provided helpful comments. 

- Biographical information is provided about author Sam Harris, including his background, other published works on related topics like morality and religion, and role as CEO of Project Reason.

- Endnotes provide references and additional context for some points made in the essay. One note distinguishes between negative and positive injunctions as relates to lying and truth-telling.
