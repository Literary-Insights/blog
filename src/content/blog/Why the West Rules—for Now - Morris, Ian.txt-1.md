 Here is a summary of the reviews:

- Niall Ferguson calls the book "the nearest thing to a unified field theory of history we are ever likely to get." He praises Morris' use of techniques from the new ancient history to address why the West beat the Rest. 

- Andrew Marr says it is a "great work of synthesis and argument" that draws on a vast range of sources to provide a fresh perspective on East-West relationships, and weaves lessons from thousands of years of history towards a "startling and scary conclusion."

- Anthony Pagden calls it the "true magister vitae - the ‘teacher of life’" and says anyone who wants to understand where they and their descendants came from must read this book. 

- Richard Wrangham says the book "sparkles as much with exotic ideas as with extraordinary tales" and is both a riveting story and major step towards an integrated theory of history.

- Several others praise the book's vision and scope in attempting to explain the East-West divide and dominance over the longue durée, as well as its lively writing style and impressive combination of rigorous scholarship with insights from other fields. Many see it as an important contribution to understanding patterns in global history.

So in summary, the reviews universally praise the book for its ambitious attempt to develop a unified theory explaining historical patterns of East-West relations and dominance over thousands of years, drawing on a vast array of sources and fields in a lively, readable way. Reviewers see it as an important work that provides novel insights into long-term trends shaping global history.

 Here is a summary of the key points from the passage:

- The story is set in an alternate history scenario where China conquered and colonized Britain in the 19th century, rather than the other way around. 

- Governor Qiying of China arrives in London to receive tribute from Queen Victoria and install Britain as a vassal state of the Chinese Empire. 

- Victoria and her husband Prince Albert kneel in the rain to receive Qiying and listen to a proclamation declaring Britain subordinate to China.

- To Victoria's horror, Albert is taken away to Beijing to be invested as a vassal of the Chinese Emperor. She swoons at his departure. 

- Albert is kept in the Forbidden City in Beijing and grows disillusioned, never returning to Britain. He eventually dies after 13 years in isolation. 

- Victoria shuts herself away in mourning while Qiying rules Britain on behalf of China. The story presents a reversal of the actual historical relationship between Britain and China.

 

- The story introduces a Chinese ship called the Qiying that sailed to London in 1848, but embellishes the details for dramatic effect, such as portraying it as an ironclad gunboat bringing a Chinese governor to accept British submission. In reality it was just a wooden junk. 

- Queen Victoria, Prince Albert and the Duke of Wellington did visit the ship, but not to bow before a new Chinese master. They came as tourists. 

- The story about Emperor Daoguang tearing Victoria and Albert apart is fictional. In reality they lived together until Albert's death in 1861. 

- The Opium Wars were sparked by Britain pushing opium in China to turn a trade surplus. When China banned opium, Britain went to war to demand compensation for confiscated opium and force China to open new ports to trade. 

- The wars devastated China and weakened the Qing dynasty. A man named Hong Xiuquan had a religious vision and started a rebellion, the Taiping Rebellion, taking over large parts of China. 

- 20 million died in the Taiping Rebellion, one of the deadliest wars in history. Western powers further intruded in China during this time of weakness. 

- After the wars, Queen Victoria was gifted a Pekinese dog named Looty from artifacts looted from the Summer Palace in Beijing, finding companionship after Albert's death.

 

- There are two broad theories for why the West came to rule globally: "long-term lock-in" theories and "short-term accident" theories. 

- Long-term lock-in theories suggest some critical factor from ancient times made East and West massively different, ensuring the industrial revolution would occur in the West. They disagree on what the factor was but see Western domination as inevitable.

- Between 1750-1950, most explanations took a long-term lock-in view, often arguing Western culture was superior due to roots in ancient Greece/Rome. Some Eastern intellectuals accepted this, seeing their own cultures as going wrong long ago.

- Short-term accident theories saw Western dominance as no foregone conclusion, but resulting from contingent historical events. They gained traction in the 20th century as Western power faced new challenges.

- The passage explores the debate between these perspectives and how Eastern intellectuals grappled with Western military/economic superiority from the late 19th century onward. It sets up the author's intent to examine why the West rules from an evidence-based historical approach.

 

- In the late 19th/early 20th century, some intellectuals in China were studying Western books on evolution and economics to understand how the West had come to rule. They concluded the Western rule was long-term but not permanently locked in, and that by rejecting its own past, China could still catch up. 

- However, some Western thinkers believed cultural factors made the West inherently superior. They claimed the East was too hot, disease-ridden, crowded, etc. for an innovative culture to develop.

- Karl Marx argued Western rule was politically "locked in" because Oriental states had centralized power for thousands of years, stopping historical progress, while Europe progressed through different systems. Later Communists adjusted this theory. 

- Zheng He's voyages in the early 15th century challenge long-term theories, as Chinese navigation was then more advanced than Europe's. However, historians have adjusted theories, arguing factors like disease/demography or centralized Chinese rule prevented further exploration.

- In recent decades, some "short-term accident" theorists argue similarities between East/West outweighed differences until 1800, and Western dominance was temporary rather than locked in from the past. They question long-held assumptions about why the West ultimately dominated.

 

There are two schools of thought on why the West came to dominate globally over the past 200 years: long-term theorists and short-term theorists. Long-term theorists believe factors like Greek culture laid the foundation for Western dominance thousands of years ago. Short-term theorists argue it was more recent events like the industrial revolution that gave the West its advantage. 

Jack Goldstone argues East and West were equally developed until 1600, but the Protestant rejection of tradition in Europe allowed for scientific advancements that fueled the industrial revolution. Kenneth Pomeranz believes industrialization was a "gigantic fluke" - in 1800, Britain alone had sufficient coal resources to power mechanization while escaping a looming global ecological crisis. 

The author argues both long-term and short-term theories have limitations because they don't fully examine all of human history. As an archaeologist and ancient historian, the author looks at the entire sweep of history to better establish its overall "shape" before analyzing what led to Western dominance in recent centuries. Examining broader time periods reveals more parallels between societies than advocates of uniquely Western traditions acknowledge. Understanding the entire human story is needed to resolve debates between long-term and short-term explanations.

 Here are the key points about why the West rules according to the summary:

- The author argues that asking why the West rules is really a question about social development - societies' ability to shape their environments and get things done. 

- In the 19th century, Western observers assumed social development was an unquestioned good associated with progress. Now there are more debates about its costs.

- To answer why the West rules, we need to examine long-term and short-term factors, as well as compare social development levels across regions over time.

- Looking at social development trends reveals that the West has been the most developed region for 14 of the last 15 millennia. But Eastern regions were more developed than the West for over 1000 years from 550-1775 CE. 

- Neither long-term nor short-term factors alone can explain why the West came to dominate globally in the last 200 years. A combination of long and short-term trends was at play.

- The author will use biology, sociology, and geography as analytical tools or "lenses" to help explain the patterns seen in social development trends and the rise of the West. Biology shows humans are clever chimps, while sociology examines what drives social change.

So in summary, the author seeks to explain the dominance of the West by analyzing long-term trends in social development across regions over thousands of years, using insights from multiple disciplines.

 

The passage discusses the idea of location determining historical outcomes. It argues that while biology and sociology can explain universal patterns of social development, geography helps explain regional differences. 

Specifically, it defines "the West" as societies descending from the earliest agricultural core region in Western Eurasia, where domestication began around 9500 BCE. "The East" refers to societies descending from the second oldest core in East Asia, where domestication began around 7500 BCE. 

The passage claims these two core regions grew to dominate their respective hemispheres as agriculture and population grew. While all societies faced similar pressures of development, geographical advantages allowed some cores to develop faster than others.

This helped the Western core achieve uniquely dense concentrations of domesticable plants and animals, giving it an early lead. But the author argues geography does not deterministically lock outcomes - what counts as an advantage changes over time as societies develop. 

The core argument is that comparing East and West can best explain why particular Western societies, especially North American ones, have come to globally dominate in modern times. The passage aims to focus the book on this East-West comparison.

 

The book takes a global and long-term approach to exploring the development of Eastern and Western societies over the last 15,000 years. While a fully global account would be richer, it would also lose focus and be too long. 

The author argues that geography initially drove differences in social development between East and West, but rising development then changed the meaning and importance of geography over time. Regions that were initially disadvantaged could later gain advantages through developments like new ship technologies or access to trade routes. 

Core regions of higher development also shifted locations periodically within the East and West. Factors like control of trade routes, access to resources, and state building drove these shifts. Collapses and disruptions further caused development levels to fluctuate between the East and West over millennia. 

The book is divided into three parts. Part I establishes definitions and sets the biological and geographical context. Part II provides a detailed comparative history, exploring key similarities and differences over time. Part III analyzes the author's overarching argument that biological, social, and geographical "laws" shaped global patterns and the interplay between East and West. It also speculates on potential future developments and disruptions.

 

- The passage begins by questioning the concept of "the West" and what it encompasses. It notes there are many differing definitions that are elastic and can be shaped to various geopolitical interests. 

- It argues we should avoid making assumptions about Western values and look back through history, instead starting at the very beginning and moving forward in time to see distinct regions emerge. Only then should we label the westernmost region "the West" and easternmost "the East."

- It discusses theories of the beginning of the universe from astrophysicists, noting we need not go back that far. Eventually humans are introduced as the necessary ingredient for distinguishing East and West.

- The origins and evolution of humans is explored, with the earliest identifiable humans emerging around 2.5 million years ago in East Africa based on evidence of bipedalism, larger brains and crude tool use. This marks the beginning point to then track the emergence of distinctive regions that could be labeled East and West.

 Here is a summary of the key points about Homo habilis:

- Homo habilis (Latin for "Handy Man") lived in East Africa around 2-1.8 million years ago. They were the first species in the genus Homo.

- They had long arms suited for tree climbing but also walked upright on two feet. They used stone tools but were still fairly apelike. 

- They may have scavenged meat but were probably not skilled hunters. Debate exists around whether they were more hunters or scavengers. 

- Homo habilis disappeared suddenly around 1.8 million years ago as the climate changed and new species like Homo erectus emerged with bigger brains and bodies better suited for life on the savannah grasslands replacing the forests.

- Homo erectus dispersed more widely out of Africa than Homo habilis, with early examples found as far as modern-day Georgia and China at sites dated to 1.7-1.6 million years ago. 

- An east-west distinction may have emerged by 1.6 million years ago, with Acheulean hand axes commonly found in populations west of the "Movius Line" but rougher stone tool types more common in Eastern Asia. However, the exact reasons and timing of this division are unclear.

 

- The Movius Line marks a division in tool technology between Western regions that used Acheulean hand axes and Eastern regions that used simpler tools like choppers due to a lack of stone resources. 

- Later waves of migration out of Africa brought Acheulean hand axes to Southwest Asia and India, but not farther East. The types of stones needed for hand axes became rare in Eastern areas.

- Archaeologists theorize that as hominins moved East across the Movius Line, they gave up hand axes when they could not replace broken tools, instead using alternatives like bamboo.

- Finds from Bose Basin in China provide support, showing hominins there switching temporarily to hand axes after a meteor impact destroyed local bamboo resources.

- There is debate around whether hominins like Homo erectus in the East were a separate species (Homo erectus) from those in Africa/Southwest Asia (Homo ergaster). This has implications for ideas about innate regional differences in humans.

- Sites in China like Zhoukoudian provide evidence of hominins like Peking Man evolving physiques adapted to colder climates starting around 600,000 years ago. However, the origins and fate of artifacts from this site remain unclear.

 

- Populations isolated on islands often evolve into dwarf forms over many generations, like Homo floresiensis ("hobbits") on Flores island. Their small size by 16,000 BCE suggests Homo erectus colonized Flores hundreds of thousands of years earlier, showing communication ability to cross seas.

- Homo erectus at Zhoukoudian cave in China could communicate better than great apes and control fire. Evidence suggests they hunted horse heads and may have practiced cannibalism. 

- Western ape-men like Homo antecessor and Homo heidelbergensis in Europe had bigger brains than Homo erectus. They made more advanced stone tools, showing better cognition.

- Neanderthals emerged in Europe by 200,000 BCE. They were strong hunters with bigger brains than modern humans. Evidence shows they used complex tools, hunting weapons, and practiced cannibalism. Some Neanderthals survived severe disabilities, showing they helped each other.

- In summary, while Eastern and Western ape-men differed, Neanderthals displayed more advanced cognition, tool use, hunting and social behaviors compared to Homo erectus.

 

- Neanderthals had the cognitive and physical capabilities to create basic tools, clothes, and fire. However, they likely struggled without social support from others. 

- Some scientists believe Neanderthals may have had basic speech capabilities based on features like their hyoid bones and brain structures. Others disagree, pointing to physical traits that suggest a more limited vocal range. Their communication was possibly through gestures and single syllable sounds. 

- In 1997, ancient Neanderthal DNA was extracted, showing they possessed the FOXP2 gene involved in speech processing. This suggested they may have had basic linguistic abilities. 

- Neanderthals lived in larger social groups than earlier humans, hunted more effectively, occupied territories longer, and cared for their dead through rituals and burials. This indicates some level of spirituality.

- Around 70,000 years ago, a new human species, Homo sapiens, emerged from Africa and replaced all other human lineages like Neanderthals through interbreeding and population replacement. Modern humans share a small percentage of Neanderthal DNA.

- Differences between modern human populations are superficial and do not support notions of genetic superiority between groups. Our shared ancestry establishes our biological unity.

 

- A genetic study suggests that human body lice evolved around 50,000 years ago when humans started wearing clothes regularly. 

- While modern humans evolved anatomically around 150,000 years ago, significant changes in human behavior and culture seemed to occur around 50,000 years ago, known as the "Great Leap Forward." 

- However, newer evidence from sites in Africa dating back as far as 160,000 years ago shows signs of modern human behaviors like using shells as tools, making arrowheads, drawing symbols, and fishing - suggesting a gradual evolution of modern human behaviors over tens of thousands of years through a series of "baby steps," rather than a single Great Leap. 

- Climate changes due to ice age cycles likely drove this gradual evolution, as harsher environments put more selective pressure on traits like intelligence and innovative problem-solving abilities starting around 190,000-90,000 years ago. This may have led to the accumulation of more complex modern behaviors over a long period.

 

- Around 100,000 BCE, estimates suggest the global population of Homo sapiens was only around 20,000 individuals, placing the species at risk of extinction due to low genetic diversity. 

- Starting around 70,000 BCE, conditions in eastern and southern Africa improved, allowing human populations to grow rapidly through increased reproduction. This growing population size helped advantageous genetic mutations to spread more widely.

- Small bands of Homo sapiens began migrating out of Africa around 60,000 BCE, reaching places like Indonesia, Australia, the Middle East, and Europe between 60,000-12,000 BCE. They dispersed much more rapidly than earlier human species.

- As Homo sapiens spread globally, other human species like Neanderthals and Homo erectus died out. While it's unclear if Homo sapiens directly killed them off or just outcompeted them, they replaced these earlier species everywhere except isolated areas. 

- Some argued in the past that differences between modern Eastern and Western populations may be due to Homo sapiens interbreeding more with Neanderthals in the West vs. earlier human species in the East. However, genetic evidence allows us to trace ancestry back to a shared ancestral human population.

 

- Geneticists studied mitochondrial DNA, which is only inherited maternally, to trace human ancestry. This avoided the difficulty of unraveling ancestry from both parents' lines.

- A 1987 study led by Rebecca Cann found that genetic diversity in Africa was greater than anywhere else. Diversity outside Africa was only a subset of African diversity. The deepest lineages all traced back to Africa.

- This indicated that the last common maternal ancestor of all living humans, dubbed "African Eve", must have lived in Africa around 200,000-150,000 years ago. 

- Later studies of Y-chromosome DNA, inherited paternally, also pointed to an "African Adam" originating 60,000-90,000 years ago in Africa.

- Some argued for a "multiregional" model where modern humans evolved separately in different regions through gene flow. But evidence has consistently supported an "out of Africa" single origin model.

- Remarkable cave paintings in Europe dating back 30,000 years were seen by some as evidence for early cultural superiority in the West. However, climate records from Antarctic ice cores indicate humans had already dispersed more widely by that time.

 

- In 2004, European scientists extracted an Antarctic ice core almost 2 miles deep, providing data going back 740,000 years. This showed temperatures during the last ice age were about 14 degrees F cooler than today. 

- During the last ice age 20,000 years ago, large glaciers covered northern parts of Europe, Asia, and America. Sea levels were over 300 feet lower and areas that are now underwater would have been dry land. Climates outside the tropics were harsh with short growing seasons.

- People lived in small bands of 12-24 individuals and followed migrating herds of animals like reindeer. They gathered periodically for social events like exchanging marriage partners and practicing rituals, which may have motivated the cave paintings in Europe.

- Cave paintings died out after 11,500 BCE as temperatures rose and reindeer herds stopped migrating as far south. This coincided with the end of cave painting tradition. Northern regions lacked suitable caves for painting.

- However, other artistic remnants have been found globally dating back 26,000-35,000 years ago, suggesting all early humans had an innate creative drive. Different environments may have motivated different artistic mediums beyond cave painting.

So in summary, climate changes at the end of the last ice age likely explain the end of cave painting tradition in Europe, but creativity was shared among early humans worldwide according to conditions.

 

- As the last Ice Age ended around 12,000 years ago, global warming caused massive environmental changes across the world. Glaciers melted, sea levels rose significantly, and climates warmed.

- These changes benefited human populations in certain "Lucky Latitudes" between 20-35 degrees north in the Old World and 15 degrees south to 20 degrees north in the Americas. Temperate zones in these areas saw an explosion of plant and animal life as resources multiplied. 

- One key area was the "Hilly Flanks" region around the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in Southwest Asia. Sites like Ain Mallaha showed settled villages forming here for the first time, with large roundhouses, stored food, and evidence of year-round habitation. 

- Settling down allowed human groups to grow larger and more permanent. Hunter-gatherers began transitioning social behaviors and relationships as places became home rather than just temporary stops on migratory circuits. This was a major shift away from past nomadic lifestyles.

- The author argues this period saw the origins of distinct regional ways of life and the beginnings of differences between "East and West." The movement up the "Great Chain of Energy" benefited humans who exploited resources through more sedentary living.

 

- For years, ancient people in the Near East buried their ancestors within and near their houses, rooting the ancestry to a particular spot. They cared for their houses, rebuilding them over generations. 

- Permanent settlements led to changes in scavenging animals. Rats and mice thrived on the constant food supply and adapted to live alongside humans, while larger scavengers were less successful. Rats spread disease but also competed with early domesticated dogs, who provided benefits by guarding settlements and killing rodents.

- Around 11,000 BCE, an elderly woman was buried at 'Ain Mallaha in the Levant with a puppy, suggesting early domestication of dogs who formed bonds with humans. Meanwhile, Ancient Near Eastern societies focused on domesticating wild plants like rye, gradually selecting for larger seeds through cultivation practices like tilling fields. This planted the seeds for agricultural practices distinguishing later Western civilization.

 

- The president is skeptical about an impending storm but it eventually erupts, trapping the main character's son in New York. Heroic efforts are made to rescue the son. 

- The summary then transitions to discussing the Younger Dryas period between 10,800-9,600 BCE, when cooling temperatures returned the world to ice age conditions. This caused villages to be abandoned and populations to revert to smaller nomadic groups as food sources declined. 

- Archaeological sites from this period show signs of religious rituals emerging, possibly as a response to communities seeking help from supernatural beings during the difficult environmental conditions of the Younger Dryas. Ritual places and practices became more elaborate compared to earlier periods prior to the climate change event.

- After the Younger Dryas ended around 9,600 BCE and temperatures rose again, villages were reestablished but incorporated significant religious elements, showing societal changes from previous warm periods before the Younger Dryas impact. Innovation and adaptation allowed human civilization to continue developing despite major climate shifts.

 

- Sites from around 9,600 BCE in modern Syria and Turkey provide evidence of elaborate rituals involving human and cattle skulls, as well as large underground communal shrines. One site in particular hints at possible human sacrifice. 

- The most spectacular site is Göbekli Tepe in Turkey, dating back to 9,000 BCE. It contains massive stone pillars carved with animal figures, some weighing over 50 tons, arranged in large underground circular structures. Such coordination suggests groups came together for regional gatherings and rituals. 

- Around 10,000 BCE, settlements in this region stood out for their advanced practices like cultivation, monument construction, and large group coordination, compared to most hunter-gatherer populations globally who still led more nomadic lifestyles. 

- By 9,600 BCE, as the climate warmed again, groups in the region resumed and expanded cultivation of crops like wheat and barley through early forms of selective breeding. Over the next few centuries, these populations domesticated plants and animals, developed permanent settlements, ground tools, and transformed their way of life. This marked the emergence of a distinctive Western civilization.

 

- Population growth led to larger early farming villages of hundreds or thousands of people by 8000 BCE, bringing problems of waste, disease, and overcrowding. Villages dealt with garbage and waste unsanitarily. Tuberculosis spread from domesticated animals to humans. 

- Settling increased food production but also increased mortality rates as populations grew. Villages expanded rapidly for a few generations until births and deaths balanced out.

- Early farmers imposed structure on their world by dividing land into private fields, pastures, and wilderness areas. Some experimental protowriting emerged. 

- Ancestor worship became important as inheritance of property from parents and grandparents was crucial for survival. Skulls of ancestors were honored and buried under houses or reburied separately. 

- Specialized religious leaders and priests emerged, claiming access to supernatural beings. Hierarchy developed within households as agriculture intensified and labor became more divided along gender lines. Observance of virginity, inheritance, and marital customs tightened.

 

The passage discusses the origins and spread of hierarchical societies and agriculture beginning around 9000 BCE in the Fertile Crescent region, known as the Hilly Flanks. By 7500 BCE, social hierarchies had developed where girls would marry older men, consolidating family holdings. Wealthier families gained more wealth and power. Rising inequality likely led to greater conflict and the emergence of fortified settlements like at Jericho by 9300 BCE. 

Agriculture spread rapidly from its origins in the Fertile Crescent. By 7000 BCE, farming dominated the region. Crops had dispersed to places like Cyprus, central Turkey, Greece and beyond by 6000-4000 BCE. While reasons for the agricultural transition were complex, higher population supported by more abundant food production likely drove expansion into new lands. Farming peoples generally settled in different areas than foraging groups at first but eventually crowded them out as populations grew over centuries. The passage argues this process increased human capture and control of energy from the environment.

 Here is a summary of the key theories about what happened after the advent of agriculture:

- Farmers may have spread diseases to hunter-gatherers, who had less resistance without permanent close contact. However, mass epidemics were unlikely as groups were separated by only a short distance, not oceans. 

- Even without epidemics, farmers' populations grew rapidly and they could overrun hunter-gatherer territory through continuous migration and colonization, outnumbering any resistance. Hunter-gatherers may have been pushed into less desirable lands.

- An alternative theory is that local hunter-gatherers did not face a stark choice but gradually took up farming as neighbors intensified cultivation and impacted foraging resources. They moved along a continuum from light gardening to intensive farming over generations rather than switching entirely. Farming spread through cultural diffusion more than displacement or competition.

- Genetic evidence initially supported farmers migrating from Western Asia and replacing indigenous hunter-gatherer lineages across Europe. But mitochondrial DNA traces multiple ancient lineages, soEurope's transition may have involved locals adopting farming more than immigration. Views have converged that about 25% of European ancestry derives from Western Asian farmers.

- In some areas like the Baltic, hunter-gatherers resisted for over 1,000 years through fortifications and possible fighting before farming moved north, showing human agency could locally halt its spread. But farming generally prevailed once established. The Baltic exception proved the overall success of intensive cultivation.

 

- The passage argues against the idea that history has immutable laws and that free will does not influence historical events. It argues that individual choices, while not changing the overall trajectory, do impact local circumstances and short-term outcomes. 

- Around 10,000 BCE, the conditions were right for the independent development of agriculture in multiple regions around the world as populations grew and people intensified their use of local plants and animals. 

- The earliest and clearest case of independent domestication outside of the Fertile Crescent was in China between 8000-7500 BCE with rice and millet cultivation. Other early sites include the Indus Valley, eastern Sahara, Peru, and New Guinea between 7000-5000 BCE. 

- These disparate regions all gave rise to distinctive cultural traditions. The passage defines "The West" as societies descended from the first agricultural core in the Fertile Crescent, and "The East" as those descended from the core in China. 

- It argues geography, not genetics, best explains why agriculture emerged first in the Fertile Crescent due to the distribution of domesticatable plant and animal species. This head start, combined with other geographic advantages, locked agriculture into expanding from this region first.

 

- By 1900 CE, only 14 plants and animals had been domesticated worldwide. Southwest Asia had 7 of these, including sheep, goat, cow, and pig. 

- East Asia had 5 potential domesticates, South America had 1, and North America, Australia, and Africa south of the Sahara had none. 

- People in the fertile crescent (Hilly Flanks region) were not inherently superior, but had more easily domesticable plants and animals than other regions. 

- Agriculture began earlier in East Asia as well, starting around 12,000 BCE with wild rice collection in China. Rice was domesticated by 8000 BCE and fully domesticated by 4000 BCE. 

- Early Chinese villages resembled those in the fertile crescent, growing from 50-100 people to 150 people by 5000 BCE, with communal ash piles and burials between houses. 

- By 5000 BCE, Chinese communities had transitioned to permanent agriculture with tools like stone spades and hoes, and rice paddies appeared by 5700 BCE.

- Differences in available resources affected when and how agriculture developed in different regions, but people were fundamentally similar in their ability and choices to domesticate plants/animals or adopt more sedentary lifestyles.

 

- Flutes dating back to 7000 BCE have been discovered in Chinese burials, with more advanced 5-6 hole flutes appearing by 6500 BCE. This indicates the development of musical performance groups. 

- Turtle shells with simple scratched signs were found in 24 rich male burials dating around 6250 BCE. Some of these signs resemble the earliest Chinese writing systems that emerged thousands of years later. 

- Evidence of continuity in religious symbolism and practices indicates shamans may have emerged as powerful ritual specialists in China as early as 6000 BCE, with connections to similar roles in places like Mesopotamia and the Near East.

- By 3500 BCE, some Chinese communities had populations of thousands and evidence of fortifications, warfare, and human sacrifice. Powerful shamans may have lived in large houses/palaces and monopolized communication with spirits and ancestors. 

- Figurines resembling Caucasian features dating to 4000 BCE suggest influence from central and western Asian shamans. Mummies found in northwest China also showed Caucasian traits.

- Two notable sites from 3600-3000 BCE provided evidence of developed spiritual beliefs involving animal spirits and goddess worship, with a minority of people buried with valuable jade goods, indicating elite religious/political roles. 

- In summary, the evidence points to emergence of hierarchical, ritual-focused agricultural societies in eastern China by 3500 BCE showing notable religious and political continuities with groups in western/central Asia from as early as 6000 BCE.

 

- The agricultural expansion in Eastern Eurasia (China, Korea, Japan etc.) followed a similar pattern and timeline to the agricultural expansion in Western Eurasia, with some exceptions. 

- In both regions, hunter-gatherers transitioned to farming over thousands of years, developing complex village settlements, domesticating crops and larger animals, and expanding agriculture geographically. 

- However, a few key developments emerged earlier in the East than West, like the appearance of pottery 7,000 years earlier and more elaborate tombs 1,000 years earlier in the East. Monumental shrines emerged earlier in the West.

- Overall though, the timing and sequence of major cultural developments were broadly parallel between East and West. This suggests the processes of Neolithic transition shared a similar cultural logic in both regions. 

- The main difference was that developments started around 2,000 years earlier in Western Eurasia. This small head start may explain why the West eventually dominated industrially. 

- Comparing cultures is challenging, as exceptions need examining to understand how they relate to overall trends. But the evidence does not strongly support the view that differences between early Eastern and Western cultures locked them into distinct long-term trajectories.

 

- In the 19th century, anthropologists sought to document human social evolution by studying contemporary non-Western societies, assuming they reflected ancestral stages. Bronislaw Malinowski criticized this approach, arguing customs must be understood in full cultural context. 

- Archaeology was in its infancy then, unable to directly provide evidence of prehistoric social evolution. So evolutionists had to speculate based on scant archaeological data combined with ethnographic reports. This allowed Malinowski to expose their theories as just-so stories lacking evidence.

- Archaeology has progressed significantly since then. Major advances included applying stratigraphic analysis in the 1870s to sequence sites chronologically, nuclear radiocarbon dating in the 1940s, and the emergence of archaeology as a professionalized science by the mid-20th century. These developments finally allowed archaeologists to directly document and impose order on prehistory, rather than relying on indirect evidence and speculation.

The key points are that early anthropology sought to prove social evolution indirectly through ethnography, which Malinowski criticized, while archaeology lacked rigorous methods to directly document prehistory until major methodological advances in the late 19th-mid 20th centuries.

 

- In the 1950s, some social scientists called "neo-evolutionists" tried to develop measures and numerical indexes of social development and differentiation across societies to search for general patterns and laws of social evolution. 

- One early attempt was by anthropologist Raoul Naroll in 1955, who scored 30 preindustrial societies on traits like settlement size, craft specialization, and social subgroups. This showed some agreement across studies despite different data and methods.

- However, neo-evolutionism faced criticism that it was imposing Western values and rankings on other cultures. By the 1960s-70s, influenced by social movements, anthropologists rejected it as ideological and simplistic. Departments polarized between evolutionist and anti-evolutionist factions. 

- While critics rightly pointed out flaws in numerical measures and ranking, the author argues indexes are still needed for large-scale questions like explaining differences in East-West development over millennia. The debate requires directly confronting long-term versus short-term theories of why the West developed advantages, rather than focusing on separate cases.

 

The passage discusses the need to develop an index to measure and compare social development across different societies and time periods in order to understand why Western powers came to dominate globally. It considers what aspects or dimensions of societies should be measured as part of such an index. 

It proposes taking lessons from Albert Einstein's view that scientific measurements should be as simple as possible while still capturing the key thing being tested. It also looks to the UN's Human Development Index as a model, which measures three core traits - life expectancy, education, and income. 

While acknowledging criticisms of such indices, the passage argues having some index is useful to structure debates by making comparisons more explicit. It lays out six criteria any dimensions included in a social development index should meet - being relevant to a society's ability to accomplish goals, measurable across different contexts, not easily manipulated, comprehensive but not redundant, and able to generate comparative scores. 

The overall aim is to establish principles for constructing a social development index that can be used to analyze why Western societies achieved global dominance by the 19th century based on their social and technological accomplishments. Simplicity and empirical grounding are prioritized over comprehensiveness.

 

- The author proposes measuring social development over time using four main traits: energy capture, organizational capacity, information processing, and military capacity. 

- These traits were chosen based on six criteria: they must reflect social development, be culture-independent, have independent variables, be adequately documented, experts must agree on the evidence, and be convenient to measure. 

- Energy capture reflects a society's ability to extract and use energy from the environment. 

- Organizational capacity is measured using urbanization as a proxy, as large cities require immense organization to function. 

- Information processing reflects a society's ability to transfer and communicate knowledge. 

- Military capacity is included as the ability to project power was ultimately what determined dominance in the 19th century case being examined.

- The author sets the maximum index score in 2000 CE at 1,000 points divided equally among the four traits, to assign preliminary numerical values in a simple way. The aim is to provoke debate on how best to measure patterns of social development over time.

 

The passage discusses how the author calculated scores for different social traits like urbanism, energy capture, etc. across history for East and West civilizations. 

For urbanism, the author focused on largest city size as a simple measurement. Scores were assigned based on the population of the largest cities from 2000 BCE to present, with Tokyo in 2000 scoring the full 250 points. 

Estimating energy capture was more complex since consumption data only exists recently. The author made estimates back to prehistoric times based on dietary needs and use of non-food energy sources like firewood. Estimates were given in kilocalories per person per day. 

The passage then discusses how Earl Cook estimated historical trends in per capita energy consumption across different societies in 1971. His estimates broke consumption into food, home/commerce, industry/agriculture, and transport. Though approximate, archaeology and other evidence has largely supported his broad trends. 

In summary, the passage details how the author calculated quantitative scores for different social traits over 15,000 years of history to compare development in East and West civilizations. Estimates were made based on available data combined with reasonable assumptions backed by archaeological and other evidence.

 Here are the key points from the summarized passages:

- Chapters 1 and 2 show that airborne pollution increased sevenfold in the last few centuries BCE, mostly due to Roman mining in Spain. Recent studies of sediments from peat bogs and lakes have confirmed this. 

- Europeans produced 9-10 times as much copper and silver in the 1st century CE compared to the 13th century CE. This required large amounts of energy for mining, transportation, and metalworking. 

- Not until the 11th century CE did pollution levels return to Roman-era levels, according to Chinese documents describing widespread deforestation around Kaifeng to supply coal for ironworking. 

- Only in 19th century Britain did pollution levels surpass those of the Roman era, as the Industrial Revolution took off. 

- This independent evidence allows comparisons of industrial activity levels between different historical periods. The framework and detailed evidence constrain estimates within about 10-20% uncertainty.

- The scores are intended to compare the overall shape of social development across long periods of history. Calculating them every century provides enough detail for this purpose going back to 1400 BCE.

- The scores reflect social development in the core regions of Western and Eastern Eurasia that dominated political, economic and cultural interactions over time. These core regions have shifted locations gradually over the millennia.

- The lines tracking social development in the West and East run very closely together, making differences hard to distinguish when looking across 16,000 years of history.

 

- The graph shows social development scores for East and West from 14,000 BCE to 2000 CE. Initially the lines are barely distinguishable and do not change much until 3000 BCE. 

- Something profound happened in the last few centuries, representing the fastest and greatest transformation in history as both lines abruptly increased around 1800 CE.

- However, using a linear scale compresses the earlier, lower scores to the point they are barely visible. A log scale solves this issue by spacing out the increases in scores.

- A log scale graph of one person's accumulating debt from borrowing money clearly shows how small initial payments can significantly impact the ending debt total, even though a linear scale hides this effect. 

- Similarly, a log scale graph of the social development scores reveals more information than the linear scale graph. It shows social development had already increased tenfold from the starting point by the time rapid growth began in the 1700-1800s.

- The log scale also shows the West did not always have higher scores - lines converged by 1000 BCE and the East surpassed the West from 541 CE to 1773 CE, indicating shifts in which region led development over the long term.

So in summary, a log scale provides better insight into social development patterns over the long run compared to a linear scale, which compresses early data and changes.

 Here is a summary of the key points in the given text:

- The story argues that most theories of Western dominance only look at parts of the full historical picture, like blind men describing an elephant based on only feeling one part. An index of social development provides a fuller view.

- Figure 4.1 shows that in the early period from 14,000-5000 BCE, as predicted by long-term lock-in theories, the West obtained an early lead in social development due to climate and ecological factors, and maintained it. 

- However, Figure 4.2 showing 5000-1000 BCE tells a more complex story that differs from the early period. It shows the East starting to catch up to the West in social development during this time, challenging the simple narrative of perpetual Western dominance.

- The story suggests we need to look at the full historical context across thousands of years, not just parts of it, to understand why the West came to rule and what may happen in the future. Bringing in evidence from the distant past provides important missing context that short-term theories overlook.

- Projecting current growth rates forward, Figure 4.9 estimates the East will regain the lead in social development by 2103. However, the author questions if these are definite "shadows of things that will be" or just possible futures that could be changed by altered circumstances, as in the Christmas Carol analogy. 

So in summary, the text challenges simplistic theories by providing a fuller long-term view of historical changes in social development between East and West, showing a more complex relationship than perpetual Western dominance. It questions definite predictions of the future and advocates learning from the full historical record.

 

- Between 14,000-5000 BCE, farming spread from the Hilly Flanks region in central Asia westward and reached the Atlantic coast, doubling Western social development scores. However, agriculture was slow to reach Mesopotamia (modern Iraq), which was close but had a harsh climate. 

- Around 5000 BCE, farmers in Mesopotamia began adapting techniques like irrigation canals to manage seasonal floods and make the lands productive. This led to the rise of large towns like Eridu and eventually cities with thousands of residents. 

- Climate change around 3800 BCE weakened monsoon rains, reducing predictable water sources for farms. This threatened the development that had been achieved. People consolidated into larger cities like Uruk for better cooperation on irrigation projects and specialized labor. Writing and administrative records emerged to manage these more complex societies.

- The transition to larger urban centers was likely difficult and forced changes to traditional organization. Temple priests may have played a role in administering the new centralized systems that helped cultures like Sumeria emerge in Mesopotamia and overcome environmental challenges through cooperation and innovation.

 

- Excavations at ancient temples have uncovered stacks of uniform dishes known as "bevel-rimmed bowls" that were likely used to distribute food. Early clay tablets also depict the symbol for "rations" as a sketch of these bowls, indicating temples controlled food distribution. 

- Writing systems that developed further showed temples controlled large tracts of irrigated land and labor. Temples grew into huge monuments dwarfing the communities that built them. 

- In Mesopotamia, ambitious religious specialists claiming special access to the gods convinced people they needed grand temples, ceremonies, and wealth to communicate with the gods. This established the priests' authority and the first cities and states around 3500 BCE. 

- A similar process occurred in ancient Egypt, where management was needed as communities squeezed together in the Nile Valley due to droughts around 3800 BCE. Early Egyptian village leaders had military and religious roles, and some grew into kings who constructed lavish tombs displaying wealth and power. 

- Around 3100 BCE, either a king named Narmer or Menes conquered Lower Egypt, unifying it with Upper Egypt into the largest kingdom yet seen with over 1 million people. Egypt diverged from Mesopotamia by maintaining a unified political structure instead of fragmenting into city-states.

 

- Ancient Egyptian kings claimed to be gods to consolidate their power and authority. This divine kingship model was adopted from examples like Narmer unifying Upper and Lower Egypt. 

- Kings achieved divinity by doing things no ordinary man could, like military conquests. Alexander the Great may have used a similar strategy after conquering Egypt in 332 BCE. 

- Egyptian pharaohs established royal capital cities, built massive pyramid tombs, and created symbolic languages and imagery to promote their god-king status. This required large bureaucracies and workforces.

- Sumerian city-states followed a similar pattern over time, with kings originally representing patron gods but later claiming semi-divine or divine status themselves through conquests and displays of power. 

- By 2350 BCE, powerful Akkadian Empire rulers like Sargon and Naram-Sin had emerged, subduing other Sumerian cities and proclaiming their own divinity. Large divine kingships had replaced the original city-state system across Mesopotamia and Egypt. 

- However, around 2230 BCE these complex divine kingship states began encountering disruptions that destabilized social development in the following 1000 years across the Western core. The internal complexity of these societies made them vulnerable to collapse.

 

- Early civilizations like Uruk established systems of centralized control where kings would direct what crops were grown in different areas and redistribute the goods, taking a portion for themselves and officials. This "command economy" model became common by 3000 BCE.

- Kings also exchanged gifts to curry favor with each other, moving goods and ideas across regions. Both the kings and merchants benefited economically from these exchanges. 

- Around 2200 BCE, the Akkadian and Egyptian empires collapsed due to environmental stresses like drought that disrupted agricultural production and trade networks. Migrations increased as people moved in search of resources.

- In Mesopotamia, the Akkadian Empire broke down and regional powers like the city of Ur rose up, though its empire also fell by 2000 BCE. Egypt reunified but went through volatile political changes during this period. 

- The collapse of large empires and emergence of smaller political units showed how centralized systems were vulnerable to external shocks like climate change that disrupted critical flows of people, goods and information between regions. However, decentralized trade and exchange continued at local levels.

 

The passage discusses social development in the Western core after 2200 BCE following major disruptions. While chaos ensued, social development continued rising and did not revert back to previous levels. The core expanded through inclusion of peripheral regions that gained new advantages. 

Herders on the Central Asian steppes began using horses and chariots for warfare around 2000 BCE. This gave mobile advantages to newer northern powers like the Hurrians, Hittites, Kassites, Hyksos and Mycenaeans. They were able to conquer parts of the older Mesopotamian and Egyptian cores due to more flexible social structures and access to chariot technology, which the core powers were slow to adopt.

By 1500 BCE, these once-peripheral regions had assimilated into an enlarged international core through trade and diplomatic ties. Power jockeying intensified amongst the "great powers" of Egypt, Babylon, Assyria, Mittani and the Hittites. Major conflicts broke out as the Hittites and Assyrians destroyed Mittani by 1320 BCE and fought increasingly over Syria, culminating in a massive battle between the Egyptian and Hittite armies at Kadesh in 1274 BCE.

 

- Between 1500-1000 BCE, states grew stronger in the Western core as sieges became more brutal and militarized elites accumulated more wealth and power. Kings extracted more taxes and labor from common people to finance wars and construction projects. 

- Long-distance trade expanded greatly. Archaeologists have found shipwrecks laden with goods from across the Mediterranean world dating to this period. Rich graves in Sardinia and Sicily suggest local chiefs were becoming kings linked to the expanding trade networks. 

- In China, developments were occurring on a slower timescale. By 2500 BCE, settled village life was widespread but no large states or cities had emerged yet like in Egypt and Mesopotamia. However, between 2500-2000 BCE, changes started accelerating as social hierarchies strengthened and elite burials with jade artifacts emerged in sites like Shandong, possibly indicating the rise of early kings. The large site of Taosi from this period may have had a sizable population of over 10,000 people with an emerging stratified society.

 

- The wealthy graves at Taosi from 2500-2000 BCE contained luxury items like painted vases, jade ornaments, and sacrificed animals, similar to the earlier site of Jiahu. The richest graves also contained musical instruments like drums, chimes, and a copper bell. 

- Kwang-chih Chang's theory was that shamans developed into kings in this period, using ritual, music and alcohol to communicate with spirits. Sites like Taosi and Jiahu provided evidence this process occurred between 2500-2000 BCE in ancient China. 

- There are references in later Chinese texts like the Rites of Zhou to the instrument types found at Taosi, indicating some memories were preserved of this early period. 

- A passage from the Springs and Autumns of Mr. Lü described kings taking the circular shape of heaven and squared shape of earth as models, linking to the circular-squared jade cong vessels appearing in rich graves from 2500 BCE. This suggests ancient memories of early priest-kings and the symbolism of their power.

- By 2300 BCE Taosi exhibited signs of developing social hierarchy and elite rule, but was suddenly destroyed around 2000 BCE, coinciding with a larger population decline and site abandonment across northern China during a possible climate-driven crisis. 

- The new center emerging after this disruption was Erlitou in the Yiluo Valley, exhibiting a new closed architectural style that may indicate more hierarchical social relations developing as priestly leadership spread out. Erlitou grew to a true city by 1900-1700 BCE and is identified by some as the capital of the ancient Xia dynasty, though others dispute references to the Xia.

 

- The passage describes archaeological finds from Erlitou, an ancient city from around 1900 BCE that represented an advancement in bronze weapon and tool production. A large bronze foundry was discovered that helped the city succeed but also produced ritual objects. 

- Erlitou's ritual bronze vessels became dominant in religious rituals for 1000 years. The king likely used these vessels to amplify his power as a conduit to the spirits. Producing them required vast resources. 

- By 1600 BCE, Erlitou had been overtaken by the new capital of Yanshi, built by the invading Shang people. The Shang then moved their capital to the larger city of Zhengzhou around 1500 BCE. 

- Zhengzhou expanded Erlitou's colonialism for resource extraction. The Shang colonial site of Panlongcheng resembled a mini Zhengzhou. Ritual vessels at Zhengzhou became even grander.

- The passage then describes the discovery of Shang dynasty oracle bones at Anyang in the late 19th/early 20th century, cementing it as the last Shang capital. Excavations revealed large-scale ritual landscapes and bronze production centered on the king communing with ancestral spirits.

 

- The Shang kings hosted elaborate funeral rituals for deceased royal ancestors to help them transition to the afterlife and maintain good relations with spirits. They buried leaders in massive tombs surrounded by sacrificed humans and animals. 

- Archaeologists have uncovered 8 royal tombs from the Shang Dynasty spanning 1300-1076 BCE. The tombs contained hundreds of sacrificed corpses and pits held thousands more sacrifices. Ritual killings mentioned in oracle bones may have totaled over 250,000 people over 150 years, focused around big funerals. 

- Shang rituals emphasized martial themes to show the king's power. Unearthed tombs still contained many weapons. The king communicated with gods like Di about conducting attacks on neighboring groups. 

- Shang armies were relatively small at around 10,000 men, compared to armies of contemporaries like the Egyptians. The Shang ruler's domain was also small, centered on the Yellow River, with tribute sent from allies elsewhere. 

- Sima Qian's historical account presented a simplified version of early Chinese history focused on main dynasties. Archaeology is uncovering many other contemporaneous states that flourished, with impressive artifacts found at sites like Sanxingdui.

 

The inscription describes hostile groups called the "Peoples of the Sea" attacking Egypt in the 12th century BCE. Led by Pharaoh Ramses III, Egypt fought off these invaders, who were a mixture of Mediterranean peoples like the Sherden (possibly Sardinians), Sheklesh (Sicilians), Danaans (Greeks), and Peleset (Philistines). 

The Peoples of the Sea had overwhelmed other civilizations like the Hittites and Syria. They reached Egypt's borders but were defeated by Ramses III. Many were killed and their bodies left unburied on the beach. 

The inscription suggests these groups were pushed into migration by factors like higher temperatures, lower rainfall, droughts, earthquakes or plagues affecting their homelands. They overwhelmed other powers and burned cities before attacking Egypt. 

While Ramses III claimed victory, some Peoples of the Sea did settle in Egypt. This period saw widespread migration, state collapses, burning of cities, and the widespread breakdown of order across the Eastern Mediterranean world in the late Bronze Age.

 

- The Shang peoples of ancient China interacted with northern and western neighbors like the Gui and Qiang peoples, who are mentioned in oracle bone records as using chariots in battle. In the early days of the Shang ruler Wuding, the Shang themselves only used chariots for hunting and were not very skilled with them, as evidenced by Wuding crashing while chasing a rhinoceros. 

- Over centuries, the Shang adopted more military use of chariots, though they did not mass them like other cultures but rather scattered them among infantry, probably for officers to ride.

- Shang relations with northern neighbors were similar to how Mesopotamian states related to Hurrians and Hittites centuries earlier - trading and fighting with some groups while playing them off against each other. One such group was the Zhou people.

- By the 1100 BCE the Zhou had formed their own state adopting Shang culture but maintaining independence. They eventually formed an alliance that threatened the Shang capital of Anyang in 1050 BCE. 

- The Shang state quickly unraveled when faced with this threat, showing social development in ancient China was catching up to the more established civilizations in the ancient Middle East and Mediterranean.

 

- In the first millennium BCE, states in both the East and West shifted from low-end to high-end models of governance to avoid collapse as social development increased. 

- Early Eastern states like the Shang dynasty were still largely low-end entities around 1000 BCE, relying on allies and local elites. When the Zhou overthrew the Shang in 1046 BCE, they faced challenges maintaining control.

- The Duke of Zhou responded by establishing semi-autonomous city-states ruled by Zhou clan members along the Yellow River valley. This was a low-cost solution, with the cities not paying taxes but supplying troops when needed. It resembled a mafia-style family business model. 

- Kings in both the East and West promoted legitimacy by claiming a divine mandate for their rule. However, this theory could also undermine kings if they ceased to behave virtuously in the eyes of local lords and elites. 

- Both the Eastern and Western cores adopted new governance institutions that allowed social development to continue increasing in parallel for several centuries without major disruptions or collapses.

 

- The Zhou dynasty in ancient China employed a combination of political and economic strategies to build and maintain power in its territory. Kings awarded followers with titles, land, chariots, and other resources in elaborate ceremonies to gain their loyalty. 

- Peasants worked fields to feed cities and provide labor to their lords. In theory fields were organized in a grid system where peasants kept most of the harvest but gave a share to their lords. This system along with tribute, taxes, and loot from battles made the elite class wealthy.

- The Zhou system depended on constant military victories, but in 957 BCE a major defeat weakened their authority. Rulers lost control over western territories and faced increasing conflicts between elite families over land. 

- Kingdoms in the western Mediterranean also recovered from a post-1200 BCE decline. The availability of cheap and abundant iron inspired technological and economic innovations. Two potential major powers emerged - the biblical Kingdom of Israel/Judah and the Neo-Assyrian Empire. However, the historical accuracy of accounts of the scale of these early kingdoms is debated.

- The Neo-Assyrian Empire adopted a combination of centralized bureaucracy and use of regional governors/lords to build large armies and expand territorially through conquest, extracting tribute and wealth. This low-cost model allowed the Assyrians to become a major regional power by the late 10th century BCE.

 

- Assyria dominated neighboring smaller kingdoms through threat of violence and military force. Defeated kings were sometimes allowed to stay in power as vassals paying tribute to Assyria. 

- Assyria instilled fear in vassal kings through public displays of graphic violence and brutality against rebels to deter rebellion. One account describes flaying skins of rebels and displaying on towers along with impaling and other gruesome punishments.

- In the 8th century BCE, both Assyria and states in China and Western Asia experienced climate changes that increased winter winds and rainfall patterns. This impacted populations and forced responses. 

- During this time, populations generally increased, putting pressure on land and resources. Local leaders gained power at the expense of weaker centralized kings. 

- The Phoenicians expanded trade greatly in this period, establishing colonies in the Mediterranean. The expanding Greek population also began settling in Southern Italy and Sicily.

- Indigenous groups like in Etruria and Sardinia also developed cities, states, and alphabets based on Greek models during this period in response to colonization pressures. 

- There is disagreement on how much colonization vs indigenous development drove changes in the western Mediterranean, but evidence suggests it was a mixture of both influences.

 

In the 8th-7th centuries BCE, periods of political instability and state breakdown occurred in both the Eastern and Western cores as populations grew and local powers challenged central authorities. However, instead of total collapse, new structures and alliances emerged that strengthened social development. 

In the West, Greek colonies expanded along with Phoenician, Etruscan, and indigenous Italian powers like Segesta. Segestans adopted Greek cultural practices to compete with the colonists. By the 5th century BCE, colonial cities like Carthage and Syracuse rivaled any in the original Mediterranean core. 

In China, the Zhou dynasty lost control of its vassals in the late 8th century BCE. External groups like the Rong assimilated into border states, expanding the Eastern core. By the 7th century, the Zhou held little real power as states like Qi, Jin, Chu, and Wu asserted dominance. Chu and Wu even claimed to descend from earlier dynasties. 

Thus in both cores, periods of political fragmentation saw new regional powers emerge and peripheral groups assimilate, rather than a complete societal breakdown. Through expansion, alliance-building, and innovation, social development rose to new highs by the 6th-5th centuries BCE, allowing cores to manage challenges and stabilize after moments of crisis.

 

- Tiglath-Pileser III was an Assyrian king who transformed Assyria from a collection of independent lands into a unified centralized empire through various reforms between 934-727 BCE. 

- Key reforms included creating a standing professional army paid directly by him rather than relying on aristocratic lords, weakening the power of the nobility, expanding the bureaucracy, and regularizing taxes on subject lands. 

- These changes strengthened Assyria militarily and financially, allowing it to expand its territory through conquest. However, continual warfare also overstretched Assyria's resources and generated new enemies.

- By 630 BCE Assyria was in decline and was eventually sacked by a coalition of Medes and Babylonians in 612 BCE. However, its imperial model of centralization was adopted by successors like the Medes and Persians.

- Persian ruler Cyrus the Great went on to establish the vast Achaemenid Persian Empire by 550 BCE, adopting aspects of Assyrian imperial governance and expanding all the way to Egypt and Asia Minor. His successors like Darius I further developed the imperial system and monetized taxation.

So in summary, Tiglath-Pileser's reforms set the model for later empires like Assyria, Media and Persia, but Assyria's constant warfare ultimately led to overextension and collapse, paving the way for new powers to arise like the Persians.

 

- Darius I of Persia expanded the empire through various means, including sending his first fleet to explore the Mediterranean, cutting a canal linking the Red Sea and Mediterranean, and gaining control of Greek cities. According to Herodotus, Darius also sent spies to scope out Italy and considered attacking Carthage. 

- By the time Darius died in 486 BCE, social development in both the Eastern and Western cores had progressed to around 24 points on Jaspers' scale, up from 12 points centuries earlier. Irrigation farming had increased food production, and large cities like Babylon were emerging. 

- In the Eastern core, states like Jin, Qi, Chu, and Qin were centralizing power by appointing governors directly rather than relying on aristocrats. Reforms boosted economies, populations, and armies. Ironworking and early steel manufacturing developed. Trade and coins emerged. 

- However, powerful ministers often challenged rulers for control. Solutions included appointing loyal administrators called "shi" from other states. Literature praised virtuous shi advisers. By 450 BCE, around four major states dominated China. 

- Across the cores, rulers were adopting more centralized "high-end" models of governance with professional bureaucracies and standing armies, funded by raised taxes. Societies were becoming more complex, literate, and economically developed.

 

- The passage discusses how certain ancient texts from different parts of the world, including Daoist and Jain documents in South Asia, Greek philosophy in the West, and the Hebrew Bible with its descendants like the New Testament and Quran, became highly influential classics that shaped the meaning of life for many. 

- However, the original founders of these traditions like the Buddha and Socrates wrote little themselves. Their ideas were recorded, interpreted, and developed by successors, sometimes long afterwards, so the original teachings were not always clear. Modern scholarship has shown how the texts were heavily edited over time.

- The classics discussed indefinable transcendent concepts like nirvana, ren, the good, and the kingdom of heaven, using metaphor and parable rather than direct definition. Different traditions developed various techniques like meditation, conversation, study, ritual to attain transcendence. 

- In China around 500-300 BCE, there was a flowering of diverse philosophical schools, including Confucianism, Daoism, Mozi/Mohism, and Legalism. They had varying perspectives on concepts like ren (humaneness) and dao (the Way) and different views on ethics, politics, and how to achieve harmony.

 

- Legalism was a school of thought in ancient China that promoted an authoritarian form of governance based on rigid laws and harsh punishments. Legalists believed order and strength come from using "wicked" people to govern others and enforcing laws uniformly without exception. 

- Chinese thought during this period (around the 3rd century BCE) varied widely from mysticism to authoritarianism. Scholars like Xunzi combined elements of Confucianism, Mohism, Daoism, seeking a middle ground. Ideas were continually combined and reinterpreted over centuries. 

- Axial age thought in other regions like South Asia and the West also exhibited great diversity and evolution of ideas. Even in smaller Greece, responses ranged from democracy to philosophers like Socrates who criticized democracy. Thinkers there explored a wide range of political, ethical and metaphysical perspectives.

- The real unity of axial age thought was its diversity. Despite regional differences, the scope and nature of intellectual debate was remarkably similar. This constituted a break from earlier periods that lacked such philosophical questioning. 

- The growth of large bureaucratic states preceded, rather than resulted from, the emergence of axial age philosophy. These ideas were later incorporated and guided by rulers, contributing to further social development. Axial thought reacted against power structures rather than enabling their initial rise.

 

- Qin and Rome both rose from periphery territories to conquer large empires against the expectations of cultured elites in the core regions. 

- Qin had long been one of the weaker Chinese states but adopted Legalist authoritarian reforms to greatly increase its military strength through conscription, taxation, and harsh discipline. Its strength came from being able to field significantly larger armies than its rivals. 

- After centuries of constant warfare between the Chinese states, Qin embarked on a brutal conquest from the late 3rd century BCE, killing around 1 million soldiers in total. It annihilated all rival states and united China by 221 BCE under Emperor Qin Shihuang. 

- Rome's path was different as it expanded from the edge of the Greek/Italian cultural sphere. Defensive state formation in response to Persian aggression helped develop Rome militarily. It eventually defeated Carthage and conquered the Mediterranean region in a similar time frame to Qin's conquest of China. 

- Both Qin and Rome achieved success through superior numbers - being better than rivals at raising, supplying, and replacing large armies despite coming from peripheral territories originally deemed uncivilized by core elites. Their rapid rises shocked observers and helped transform their regions.

 

- Alexander the Great tried to convince Persians he was divine, which may have succeeded over time, but made him look more insane to Greeks/Macedonians as he emphasized his divinity more. 

- Alexander died young in 323 BCE, possibly poisoned. His generals then fought civil wars, broke up his empire, and gradually became kings in their own right, edging toward claiming divinity themselves. 

- One of Alexander's successors' kingdoms may have reconquered the others over time, imitating China's Qin dynasty, but they lacked Alexander's time. 

- Rome provides an example of how developments on the periphery expanded imperial cores. Rome adapted Greek influences while growing strong against neighbors through a mix of high- and low-level organization like taxes and plunder. 

- Successful Roman generals were awarded divine-like triumphs for a day to contain ambitions of kingship, generating huge manpower through this system. 

- In long wars, Rome ground down huge Carthaginian forces, redefining brutality, and subsequently conquered the remnants of Alexander's empire in the east. Rome became the sole superpower of the West.

 

- Indian nationalists were questioning why Wheeler, a British archaeologist known for his work on Roman sites in Britain, was appointed to oversee archaeological work in India. They felt he lacked relevant experience for India. 

- Wheeler was determined to prove his skills and expertise. On a trip to museums in Chennai and Pondicherry, he discovered fragments of Roman amphorae and other artifacts, showing Mediterranean trade had reached southern India centuries ago. This directly answered the question of what Roman Britain had to do with India.

- Excavations at sites like Arikamedu revealed trade between Rome/Mediterranean and India going back to 200 BCE, with goods increasing over the following centuries. This showed the earliest traces of connectivity between East and West.

- The trade involved multiple intermediaries and the exchange of luxury goods like silk, spices, wine and metals over vast distances by sea and along emerging routes like the Silk Road. This was just the beginning of global connectivity and exchange. 

- The rising connectivity also brought issues, as nomadic peoples from central Asia increasingly migrated westward in search of pastureland, sometimes raiding agriculturally based empires and disrupting their stability. Figuring out how to manage relations with the nomads would continue challenging rulers in both East and West for centuries.

 

- After peaking around 1 BCE/CE, social development declined significantly in both the Eastern and Western cores over the next few centuries, with development scores falling over 10% in the East and over 20% in the West by 400-500 CE. 

- The mighty empires that dominated the cores had civil unrest and internal problems. In China, the repressive Qin dynasty collapsed shortly after the First Emperor's death in 209 BCE, leading to civil war. In Rome, its institutions struggled to govern a vast empire, resulting in periods of civil war over several decades. 

- The Qin dynasty abruptly disintegrated due to resistance against the emperor's harsh and oppressive policies, forced labor projects, and mass executions he imposed. Liu Bang established the more stable Han dynasty in its place in 206 BCE. 

- Rome experienced a more gradual decline into civil war as its senate and assemblies, designed for a city-state, struggled to manage conquest resources and powerful generals with private armies became disloyal to the state. This continued political instability and warfare dragged on for around 50 years.

 

- By the 1st century BCE, the Roman Republic had transformed into a Roman Empire ruled by Augustus Caesar. Through compromise and presenting himself as just a private citizen, Augustus was able to avoid overt opposition and establish himself as the de facto emperor. 

- Around the same time, the Chinese Han Dynasty had consolidated control over most of Eastern China after the fall of the short-lived Qin Dynasty. Both the Roman and Han empires pursued strategies of compromise to integrate rival groups and prevent rebellion or civil war.

- This period saw the rise of large, stable empires in both Europe/Mediterranean and East Asia for the first time. Increased peace and security under the empires led to population growth and economic prosperity based on agriculture, trade, and early industrial activities like watermill technology. 

- By pursuing integration and addressing people's basic demands through policies like reduced taxes and military service, the Roman and Han empires were able to maintain stability and last for centuries, in contrast to the short-lived Mauryan Empire in South Asia which disintegrated after conquering the region.

 

- The passage shows a graph comparing the rise and fall of Mediterranean shipwrecks and lead pollution in a Spanish lake over time. Both peak in the 1st century BCE, indicating strong links between trade and industry in ancient Rome. 

- Trade likely boomed more in the Western Roman Empire than in China's Han Empire because a higher proportion of Romans lived near navigable waterways like the Mediterranean Sea, which facilitated transport. Major Chinese rivers were sometimes impassable. 

- Economic growth in both empires was driven by state expansion (taxation) and climate change. Strong empires could exploit beneficial climate conditions to farm new lands and diversify economically. 

- The Roman and Han Empires incorporated areas made more productive by the Roman Warm Period climate. This helped offset problems from warming in core regions. 

- Per capita consumption and living standards increased greatly in both empires compared to earlier times, though conditions were still poor by modern standards. 

- When empires were strong, they dominated nomadic peoples on their borders, but when weak, nomads pushed back, like the Parthians who came to control parts of the Persian Empire. The Parthians posed persistent problems for Rome.

 

- Maodun united the fractious Xiongnu tribes into the first nomadic empire in the late 3rd century BCE. He funded the empire through plundering China during its civil wars. 

- The Han emperor Gaodi tried unsuccessfully to defeat the Xiongnu militarily. He then initiated a "harmonious kinship" policy of marrying his daughter to Maodun and providing annual gifts, though this did not stop Xiongnu raids.

- After over 60 expensive years, Emperor Wudi resumed military campaigns against the Xiongnu from 129-119 BCE. Though costly, this weakened Xiongnu control and they acknowledged Han rule by 51 BCE.

- Increased contact along Silk Road led to sharing of ideas but also disease. Ancient China, Rome, and India had evolved separate disease pools. Merging pools in 2nd century CE likely caused epidemics like plagues in Chinese and Roman army camps in 161-162 CE. Repeated plagues ravaged populations every generation thereafter.

- The Old World disease exchange through increased contact along trade/steppe routes likely bypassed India, suggesting it spread along Silk Road more than Indian Ocean routes. This had profound demographic impacts on Afro-Eurasia.

 

- In the late 2nd century CE, epidemics of unknown diseases began spreading through China, carried along trade routes from Central Asia. Descriptions of the diseases sounded similar to measles or smallpox. 

- The diseases had devastating effects, reducing populations, trade, and tax revenues. Climate changes at the same time also made conditions worse, with cooler temperatures and reduced rainfall. 

- The Han dynasty was already weakening due to the decentralization of power to wealthy landowners. The imperial government had reduced support for the military and lost control over some border areas. 

- When the epidemics and climate issues struck, the government was unable to coordinate an effective response. Factional fighting broke out in the imperial court, further paralyzing leadership. Local strongmen took control of defense. 

- People sought explanations for the crises, and a religious leader gained followers by claiming that sin, including the sins of the ruling dynasty, had caused the diseases. He prophesied the coming end of the Han dynasty. 

- With no restoration of strong central authority, the Han dynasty disintegrated in the early 3rd century CE amid continuing epidemics, unrest, and external threats on the borders. The confluence of disease, climate change, and political instability led to the loss of the divine mandate and collapse of the dynasty.

 

The Han dynasty in China collapsed in 189 CE due to various internal and external factors. This led to a chaotic period with many rebellions and warlords vying for power. By 220 CE, Cao Cao had taken control of northern China but lacked authority over the entire empire. After his death, three kingdoms emerged to battle for supremacy. Meanwhile, nomadic groups like the Xiongnu invaded northern China, destabilizing the region. By 316 CE, the Jin dynasty that succeeded Cao fell to the Xiongnu, and northern China descended into a dark age of warfare, famine, and plague. The Eastern Jin court fled south but also faced internal divisions. Overall, the fall of the Han marked the start of prolonged strife and instability in China, with devastating consequences for the population.

 Here are the key points about serfs from the passage:

- Serfs were peasants who had been made dependent on landlords. Landlords turned free peasants into serfs by organizing them into militias and making them dependents. 

- As central government control declined in both the Roman Empire and Han China, powerful landlords squeezed the peasantry and turned them into serfs. This gave the landlords military and economic control over the land and peasants. 

- Serfdom developed as emperors and central governments lost power relative to local grandees/landlords. The landlords organized military defense at the local level and gained control over land and peasants. Peasants lost freedoms and became serfs tied to the lands of their lords. 

- The emergence of powerful landlord classes and serfdom of peasants was a consequence of the declining authority of imperial governments in both Rome and Han China during periods of crisis in the 3rd-4th centuries CE. Local power filled the vacuum left by weaker central states.

 

The stability and economic integration of the Roman Empire began to deteriorate in the 4th century CE. As the west drifted away from trade networks, powerful landlords gained control over peasants. Climate change, epidemics, and migrations of peoples from the steppe continued posing challenges. 

Around 350 CE, the Huns moved westwards across Central Asia, displacing other nomadic groups. The Goths, fleeing the Huns, asked Rome for permission to settle inside the empire. However, Emperor Valens mishandled their arrival in 376 CE and lost control of the situation. At the Battle of Adrianople in 378 CE, the Goths heavily defeated the Romans, killing Valens and many troops. 

This opened the door for further invasions by Germanic tribes into Gaul and Italy over subsequent decades, as the western empire faced multiple threats and its armies became dominated by Germanic soldiers and leaders. Major blows included the sack of Rome by the Goths in 410 CE and the Vandals conquering North Africa in 439 CE, cutting off a key source of grain for Rome. Attempted recoveries by eastern emperors, such as attacking the Vandals in 468 CE, ultimately failed due to circumstances like unfavorable winds. By the late 5th century, the western Roman Empire had collapsed amid these prolonged invasions and agricultural/economic difficulties.

 

In chapter 5, the author discusses the "great-man theory of history" which argues that individuals like Tiglath-Pileser shaped major events, rather than impersonal forces. Regarding the fall of Rome, the author asks what might have happened if Basiliskos had been more competent and not gotten trapped on the coast by the Vandals. He may have retaken Carthage, but it's unclear if that would have restored Italy-North Africa economic ties, as the Vandals had only been in Africa for 40 years. Alternatively, the powerful Odoacer was already eyeing Italy. 

By 476, preserving a Mediterranean-wide empire was beyond anyone's power. The end of Rome came gradually, not with a dramatic event. Economic decline, political breakdown, and migrations could not be reversed. The classical world had finished splitting into smaller eastern and western regions. Both maintained elements of bureaucracy and cities, but were shrinking as northern/western areas slid outside their control. Networks that had bound the earlier empires dissolved due to disease, migration, war. Kings established themselves as local feudal lords instead of maintaining empire-wide rule. The world reverted to a lower-tech subsistence existence, marked by declining trade, shrinking cities, loss of infrastructure like aqueducts, and falling population levels across the territories. Writing, coinage, and numeracy faded from common use.

 

- Buddhism first entered China in the 1st century CE but did not gain many followers initially. This changed in the late 3rd century due to the efforts of Dharmaraksa, a Central Asian monk who translated Buddhist texts into Chinese. 

- Dharmaraksa promoted Mahayana Buddhism, which presented a simpler path to salvation than traditional Buddhism. It portrayed the Buddha as an eternal divine figure and introduced concepts like Bodhisattvas that could help followers attain enlightenment. 

- Mahayana Buddhism became popular in China for offering solutions to the chaotic times, though some radical sects engaged in violent revolts. It emphasized compassion and worshipping Buddhist figures to attain better rebirths.

- Monasticism was another aspect of Buddhism that was adapted for China through codes established by Dao'an. Monasteries played important social and economic roles as centers of stability. 

- By the 6th century, Buddhism had an estimated 30 million followers in China, showing its remarkably rapid growth. Meanwhile, Christianity was also expanding quickly in the Roman Empire during this period of crisis.

- Like Mahayana Buddhism, Christianity offered a revised "second wave" Axial religion with an easier path to salvation for more people. It too faced early disputes over doctrine but stabilized by the 2nd century CE. Christian monks and ascetics also filled leadership roles as state authority diminished.

 

- In the early 4th century, an Egyptian named Pachomius established the first Christian monastery, organizing hermits into a communal living space focused on labor, prayer, and strict discipline. This monastic model resembled Buddhist monasteries developing in China around the same time. 

- In the 5th century, Christian monasteries and convents often stabilized local economies when larger political structures broke down. They also became centers of learning and provided militias to maintain order. 

- By the late 4th century, Christianity had spread extensively throughout the Roman Empire, with over 30 million adherents when it became the official state religion in 391. Buddhism also grew rapidly in China over the same period. 

- Edward Gibbon argued that Christianity weakened the Roman Empire by promoting passivity over military virtues. However, the author rejects this, seeing the rise of salvation religions like Christianity and Buddhism as responses to destabilization from increased global connections, rather than primary causes of decline. 

- By adapting to and gaining support from political powers, these religions were able to continue spreading despite economic and political turmoil. Their growth reflects how peoples sought meaning and stability during widespread social changes.

 

- In the 6th century, Eastern social development overtook the West for the first time in 14,000 years, reversing a long-standing pattern. By 700 CE, the East's score was 1/3 higher than the West's. 

- This reversal was driven by geography. As states weakened in both East and West after 300 CE, the East was better able to recover due to developments in southern China. Northern Chinese migrants brought new rice farming techniques to the agriculturally advantageous south. Transportation and trade also improved along rivers.

- In the north, warlords and nomadic groups like the Xianbei disrupted society but also brought a modicum of order. The Northern Wei state stabilized the region but remained "low-end." Attempts to modernize by Emperor Xiaowen in the late 5th century polarized Chinese society between traditionalists and modernizers. 

- Overall, improved farming in the south and consolidation of rule in the north after centuries of disruption allowed the East to surpass the West socially and developmentally by the 6th-7th centuries through the interaction of population growth, trade, and political centralization stemming from regional geography.

 

In the late 6th century, Northern China was dominated by the powerful but weak-economy Sui dynasty, while Southern China consisted of fragmented states with weak institutions but a booming economy. This setup enabled the rapid growth and integration of China under the Sui. 

The Sui emperor Wendi used his large army to quickly conquer the South in 589, absorbing the wealthy Yangzi Valley without protracted war. Although Southern elites rebelled against taxation, they were defeated within a year. 

The Sui reunification allowed Northern China to tap into the South's new economic opportunities, while the South's boom spread across China. A key development was the Grand Canal, built for military reasons but which became an economic lifeline, transporting Southern rice to feed burgeoning Northern cities. 

This period saw enormous economic growth and urbanization, with the capital Chang'an becoming the largest city in the world at over 1 million people. However, excessive bureaucracy and regulation also constrained development. Still, advancement came from a more meritocratic civil service and greater social mobility. 

The unique empress Wu Zetian rose to power through the system, becoming China's only female ruler, though her authoritarian reign was controversial. Overall, this was a transformative period that set the stage for China's golden age under the Tang dynasty.

 

- Chinese culture in the 6th century was open to foreign influences from Central Asia and beyond, through the Silk Road. Many elites had mixed Chinese and Central Asian ancestry. 

- Fashions, sports, religions, and other cultural aspects were blended with these foreign influences. DNA evidence suggests some migration of Europeans to northern China as well. 

- This period of openness and blending of cultures was enabled by China's reunification under the Sui dynasty in 589, which established a powerful state and opened up economic development in southern China.

- Meanwhile, the Byzantine Emperor Justinian aimed to reconquer former Roman territories in the 6th century Western core, but faced greater challenges than China did. He had to contend with numerous independent barbarian kingdoms rather than a single unified opponent.

- Justinian also had to fight wars against the Persian Sassanid Empire, weakening his forces. A plague pandemic starting in 541 further devastated Byzantine lands and populations. 

- In contrast to China's economic growth and frontier expansion, Justinian's conquests did not capture new wealthy territories. The Western core lacked opportunities for comparable social and economic development to turn the tide.

 

- After the Plague of Justinian in the 6th century, wages rose for survivors but costs also increased, like for laundry services. Justinian tried to cap wages at pre-plague levels but it was ineffective. 

- Land was abandoned, cities shrank, taxes declined, and institutions broke down. Everyone ended up worse off. 

- Over the next two generations, the Byzantine Empire collapsed. Britain, Gaul, Italy, and parts of Spain had already fallen. The economic and political collapse then spread to the Byzantine heartland. Constantinople's population fell by three-quarters. 

- Persia's King Khusrau II sought to recreate the old Western Roman Empire. He captured Jerusalem in 614 and other lands, gaining much of the Byzantine Empire by 626. 

- However, Khusrau's empire then rapidly collapsed after his death in 628. The Byzantine emperor Heraclius defeated the Persians by allying with Turkic tribes and regained lost territories for Byzantium by 630. 

- This marked the death throes of the ancient Roman and Persian empires. Both empires had destabilized the region through warfare and drawn in Arab tribes as mercenaries and clients. This paved the way for the emergence of Arab forces in the region.

 

- By the 630s, many Christians in Egypt and Syria welcomed Muslim rule, as debates over the nature of Christ had led to much bloodshed between different Christian sects. 

- The Arab conquests happened remarkably fast - just 4,000 Muslims invaded Egypt in 639 and conquered it with little resistance. Within a century, the Arabs had conquered most of the wealthy territories of the Byzantine and Persian empires. 

- By 700, the Islamic world had become the new Western core, with Christendom as a northern periphery. The conquests did not destroy social development as the invading armies were small and faced little resistance. 

- However, the reunited cores of the East and West proved politically unstable. The Tang dynasty in China collapsed in the late 8th century due to infighting sparked by the emperor's favoritism of a military general. 

- The huge Arab empire lacked a strong central authority like an emperor. Leadership passed loosely from caliph to caliph based on close ties to Muhammad rather than a strong hereditary claim. This decentralized nature made long-term stability difficult to achieve.

In summary, the rapid Arab conquests reconfigured the geopolitical makeup of Afro-Eurasia, but reunifying the Eastern and Western cores did not lead to sustained political consolidation or an immediate resurgence of social development in the West relative to the East. Both cores struggled with either too much or too little centralized authority.

 

- The early Muslim caliphs maintained much of the existing administrative structures in the conquered Byzantine and Persian empires, keeping taxes flowing to the new Arab rulers. They established Arab military garrisons in strategic areas to assert control. 

- There was ambiguity around the role and authority of the caliph - were they political or religious leaders? This caused issues over who they should represent. 

- Succession disputes and disagreements over the nature of authority in Islam led to civil war and the rise of different factions like the Shiites. 

- Caliph al-Ma'mun sought to establish religious authority by gaining control over interpretations of the Quran and alignment with Shiite factions, but these maneuvers backfired and weakened the caliphate. 

- Al-Ma'mun then established a Turkish slave army for military power, but like other rulers, found nomadic armies uncontrollable. The caliphs lost power and provinces were sold off to semi-independent emirs. 

- Political fragmentation had different impacts in China and Western Eurasia due to geographical differences. In China, development continued advancing due to internal migration and merchant power, while fighting disrupted parts of northern China and Japan. 

- In Western Eurasia, early gains from connecting the Roman and Persian worlds were offset by later barriers dividing the Muslim world from Christendom and between Muslim regions after the caliphate broke up. Some areas like Spain and Egypt could rely on internal trade, while others declined.

 

- In the 8th century, Iraq's irrigation network was devastated by conflicts between Turkic slave armies and a rebellion of African plantation slaves led by someone who claimed religious and royal titles. 

- Korea, Japan, and the Christian parts of Europe became politically fragmented as the Chinese and Muslim cores weakened in the 9th-10th centuries. Byzantines fought internally over religious imagery, and Germanic kingdoms created their own identities disconnected from the Mediterranean.

- The Franks under Charlemagne grew into a powerful kingdom by the 8th century and he was crowned Roman Emperor on Christmas 800. However, his empire was beset by Viking, Magyar, and Saracen raiders after his death in 814. His empire fragmented after his grandsons divided it in 843.

- From the 9th-11th centuries, increased atmospheric pressure in Eurasia likely caused temperatures to rise 1-2 degrees F and rainfall to decline by 10%, posing challenges but also opportunities that societies adapted to in different ways. 

- In Tunisia, a Fatimid dynasty broke from Baghdad and established rule over Egypt, building Cairo and promoting irrigation and trade. Letters reveal international commercial networks across the Mediterranean. 

- However, the Muslim core in southwest Asia declined after the Seljuk Turks migrated and took control, disrupting administration, trade, irrigation, and cities from the 11th century onward.

 

- During the Medieval Warm Period, farmers in the Seljuk territories struggled due to hot and dry weather conditions, making it difficult to cultivate their fields. The Seljuk policies further exacerbated problems as many conquerors preferred nomadic lifestyles and did not support agriculture. More Arabs abandoned farming to join the Turks in herding. 

- In response, Sunni Muslim scholars in eastern Iran established schools to develop and teach a coherent Sunni doctrine to counter growing Shiite influence. Major scholars like al-Ghazali produced foundational works that defined Sunni orthodoxy. However, some Shiites resorted to assassinating Sunni leaders.

- Though the Sunni Revival was intellectually successful, the Seljuk state was unable to withstand pressures from the climate and political disunity without strong centralized rule like in North Africa. This created opportunities for invaders on the fringes of the Muslim lands in Europe. 

- Warmer weather also allowed expanded farming and settlement in Europe. Monks led the colonization of new lands, aided by rural lords seeking to acquire wealth and territory. Local populations adapted by adopting new techniques or resisting as independent polities. However, lack of major trade routes prevented economic integration between new eastern frontiers and western towns.

 

- Abelard and Héloïse had an affair which resulted in Héloïse becoming pregnant. To avoid scandal, they married secretly but Abelard's enemies found out and had him castrated. 

- They both then withdrew into religious life but maintained a correspondence for 20 years. Abelard wrote works applying logic to resolve contradictions in Christianity. 

- Meanwhile, some Europeans moved into the Muslim world's core regions, like merchants from Italian cities who competed in Mediterranean trade. Others like Normans launched raids and conquests around the Mediterranean. 

- The Normans were originally Viking raiders but adopted Christianity and provided mercenary services. They eventually carved out their own state in southern Italy and pursued genocidal wars against Muslims in Sicily. 

- In 1095, the Pope called for the First Crusade to retake Jerusalem from the Seljuk Turks. Various armies converged and brutally sacked Jerusalem in 1099, though their control proved fleeting as the Muslim core states gradually rolled them back. 

- The crusades did not seriously threaten Islam but weakened the Byzantine Empire, which grew dependent on unreliable Norman mercenaries. Rome's influence expanded in the changing political geography of the medieval period.

 

- Han Yu and other scholars promoted reviving ancient Confucian virtues as a way to strengthen the nation during times of turmoil. Han Yu developed a new writing style to emulate the simplicity and moral tone of antiquity. 

- Emperor Wuzong cracked down on Buddhism in the 840s for fiscal and ideological reasons, making anti-Buddhist positions more acceptable. Many Chinese turned to examining Confucian classics for answers rather than Buddhist teachings.

- A Neo-Confucian movement arose among scholars and gentry who sought to perfect society by emulating Confucius and drawing from antiquity's virtue. Scholars like Ouyang Xiu and Wang Anshi offered policy reforms and advice to the state. Wang Anshi implemented major economic and military reforms as prime minister.

- At the same time, China experienced tremendous economic growth due to climate conditions, advances in agriculture, shipping, and the use of paper money and credit. Urban and rural markets flourished in a commercialized economy. Industries like textiles, printing, and iron saw major increases in production. 

- Technological innovations like the spinning wheel presaged a possible industrial revolution centuries before Europe. Overall, 11th century China saw immense economic expansion comparable to ancient Rome.

 

- Kaifeng, China was chosen as the capital city in the 11th century due to its convenient location near the Grand Canal. It grew into a bustling metropolis filled with shops, theaters, and raucous bars. 

- Demand for iron overwhelmed the local wood supply, forcing ironmasters to clearcut entire forests. Fuel shortages led to riots in 1013. 

- innovation was needed to find a new fuel source. Kaifeng was located near major coal deposits, so ironmasters began using coal instead of charcoal to smelt iron, leading to an industrial transformation. Coal mining and iron production took off. 

- However, this potential industrial revolution in China did not fully materialize. When Marco Polo visited in the late 13th century, China remained a traditional economy, though still more advanced than Europe. 

- In 1127, Kaifeng fell to invaders from the Jurchen Empire after a panic inside the city walls. This was a self-inflicted blow, as the Song Dynasty had backed the Jurchens against other enemies but then faced attack themselves, showing weaknesses in their leadership.

 

- The Jurchen people conquered northern China in the 12th century, establishing their Jin dynasty and pushing the Song dynasty south to Hangzhou. This disrupted trade between northern and southern China.

- In the early 13th century, Temujin (later known as Genghis Khan) united the Mongol tribes and began a campaign of conquest, first against the Jurchen Jin dynasty and then the Song dynasty. 

- Genghis Khan's brutal conquest destroyed cities and infrastructure in northern China, disrupting social and economic development that had been advancing the region towards industrialization. Famine and plague followed the Mongol armies, killing millions.

- After Genghis Khan's death, the Mongols continued their conquest under Ögedei Khan and Kublai Khan, finally destroying the Song dynasty in 1279. The long wars severely damaged China's complex economic systems and infrastructure, sending development into free fall. Natural disasters like floods exacerbated the devastation caused by the Mongol invasions.

 

- China was recovering from social and economic decline in previous centuries due to plagues, famines, and disease between the 1st and 4th centuries CE. This decline affected both China and Western Europe as part of a broader slowdown across Eurasia. 

- Starting in the 9th century, there was a "Second Old World Exchange" where merchants, missionaries, and migrants crossed the Silk Road and Indian Ocean trading routes, creating zones of contact between East and West. This increased technological and cultural transfer.

- The Mongol Empire further connected East and West by bringing stability to trade routes. Merchants and scholars traveled widely between China and Europe. 

- Important technologies like the wheelbarrow, horse collar, cast iron tools, paper, printing, navigation techniques spread from East to West through this contact and exchange of ideas. 

- However, the exchange also spread deadly plagues like the Black Death pandemic in the 1340s, which devastated global populations and disrupted social and economic development in both China and Europe for decades after.

 

- Crops rotted in the ground and it got too muddy for knights to fight due to poor harvests from the Black Death pandemic. People concluded God was sending a message by allowing this suffering. 

- In China, endemic banditry turned into religious revolt against the failing Mongol empire. The emperor indulged in boats and orgies while cult leaders promised redemption. By 1350 the Chinese empire was disintegrating. 

- The plague may have strengthened Islam in Egypt and Syria as people sought God's forgiveness through prayer, pilgrimages and stricter morality. But Christians saw the plague as a sign of God punishing humanity through the corrupt popes and failing Church. 

- Flagellants emerged, marching in large groups to whip themselves and sing hymns, seeking penance. Others massacred Jews despite popes saying Jews also died from the plague. Nothing stopped the disease and social development declined as with previous plagues. 

- After summarizing changes in economic, political and geographic factors between the first and second plague cycles, the summary discusses the Ottoman empire emerging in Anatolia after the Mongols and rebuilding itself through acquiring European firearms and technology to expand into Europe and capture Constantinople in 1453.

 

- As the Ottoman Turks advanced and conquered Constantinople in 1453, ending the Roman Empire, European kings competed more fiercely with each other militarily and engaged in an arms race. France and Burgundy led innovations in gunpowder weapons that rendered older weapons obsolete. 

- The new lightweight and powerful guns could be mounted on advanced warships. This military technology was expensive and helped centralizing European monarchies gain power over local lords and bishops. National states like France, Spain and England grew stronger at the expense of feudal divisions.

- In China, Zhu Yuanzhang rose from poverty to found the Ming dynasty in 1368 and reunify China after the collapse of Mongol rule. Meanwhile, commercial growth linked the Eastern core through increased trade, both foreign and domestic. Population, agriculture and finance expanded rapidly in the 14th century in both China and Japan.

- While the West was reordered through relentless warfare, the Eastern core was reordered largely through commerce, diplomacy and the centralized Ming state, with the exception of fighting on the steppe frontier against Mongol threats. Trade networks grew to include Southeast Asia, fueling the growth of states there as well.

 

The passage describes Zheng He's grand naval expeditions in the early 15th century that explored the Indian Ocean region. Zheng He led huge fleets of over 300 vessels and 27,000 men on seven trips from 1405-1433, displaying a massive projection of Chinese power. The fleets made diplomatic visits and sought tribute from coastal cities. 

While encounters were generally peaceful, the fleets did have to fight pirates in the Strait of Malacca on three occasions. Sailors visited many places, including Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Mogadishu, and Mecca. The passage then discusses the debate over whether Zheng He's fleets could have reached the Americas ahead of Europeans. Some argue they had the means and navigation skills, but most historians remain skeptical due to lack of clear evidence. 

The passage ends with a fictionalized account of Zheng He arriving in Tenochtitlan (modern Mexico City) in 1431. It describes how he joined local allies to defeat and massacre the Aztecs after a plague had already weakened them. This reflects speculation that Chinese contact with the Americas was more extensive than usually thought.

 

- The passage discusses the exploration of the Americas and how it happened through European explorers like Hernán Cortés rather than Chinese explorers like Zheng He. 

- It suggests if Zhou Man had really discovered the Americas as some claim, and the story unfolded with Mexico becoming part of the Ming dynasty instead of Spain, the modern world may have looked very different. 

- While Chinese ships were certainly capable of reaching the Americas, interest and funding for exploration waned in 15th century China under the Ming emperors after Yongle, while it increased among European monarchs like Portugal's Prince Henry.

- Henry funded expeditions down the coast of Africa which led to colonial ventures and the slave trade. Portuguese navigators eventually reached around the southern tip of Africa and opened the sea route to Asia. 

- Meanwhile, emperors in China rejected further naval exploration and the great fleets rotted away by 1500. Some historians argue a conservatism descended on China while risk-taking increased in Europe. 

- The passage questions the "great man" view of history and whether individuals like Henry and the emperors truly determined events, or if broader cultural forces were more influential in driving European expansion versus Chinese inward turn at this time.

 

During the Renaissance, scholars and artists sought to build a bridge to the wisdom and achievements of antiquity by studying ancient texts, architecture, and art forms. Through meticulous examination of ruins and manuscripts, they aimed to recreate and revive the knowledge and culture of ancient Greece and Rome. 

This inspired new thinking that went beyond mere replication of the past. Scholars made original discoveries by linking different fields of study and evaluating ideas in light of antiquity. Rennaissance figures like da Vinci and Alberti excelled across diverse disciplines including science, engineering, and the arts. Their innovative work helped transform Western culture and spread new ideas globally.

However, the Renaissance view that it uniquely propelled Europe forward has been challenged. China also experienced a renaissance centuries earlier under the Song Dynasty, as intellectuals sought to restore the best of classical Confucian thought and generated new ideas across many fields. While both cultures experienced periods of flourishing, China's momentum for exploration and expansion diminished after the 12th century due to political and social changes, even as ship technology advanced. Physical limitations also made discovery of the Americas much more difficult from East Asia than Europe. Overall, multiple cultures have undergone renaissances by critically engaging with their intellectual heritage.

 

- Zhu Xi was a Chinese philosopher and scholar from the Song dynasty who helped popularize and systematize Confucian thought. His ideas became the orthodox interpretation of Confucianism and the basis for the imperial civil service examination system.

- However, attributing too much influence to Zhu Xi would be excessive. Cultural trends like increased conservatism and the restriction of women's rights developed for other reasons in 12th century China, and Zhu's philosophy was adopted because it aligned with these trends, not the other way around. 

- Practices like footbinding, which began around 1100 CE, painfully constrained women and arose from social conservatism, not Zhu Xi's teachings. His philosophy was one part of a broader reaction to military defeat and declining development.

- When social progress resumed in 15th century China under the Ming dynasty, thinkers like Wang Yangming questioned Zhu Xi's orthodoxy. But by then, geographical and economic factors had given Europeans distinct advantages for exploration and reaching the Americas over Asians. Culture and philosophy did not determine exploration as much as physical geography and existing trade networks.

 

When European states needed more revenue after the Black Death, their rulers were open to proposals from sea captains who promised new trade routes could turn isolation into an advantage. Some proposed sailing around Africa into the Indian Ocean to avoid Venetian and Muslim middlemen. Others insisted they could reach Asia by sailing west, though most thought this route would be very long. 

Columbus underestimated the distance around the globe when he proposed reaching Asia by sailing west. However, even if his proposal had been rejected, Europeans were determined to find an Atlantic route and likely would have encountered the Americas soon anyway due to prevailing winds pushing ships west. 

Once contact was made, Native American populations collapsed due to European diseases, weapons and institutions. While individual conquistadors could have failed, more would have followed and conquered through advantages of technology and disease.

The Portuguese initially had small expeditionary forces when they rounded Africa's Cape of Good Hope and entered the Indian Ocean. They exploited their advantage of firearms to establish coastal enclaves and shipping channels. However, their tiny numbers meant their presence was more like mosquitoes than conquistadors. The first Portuguese envoy to China, Tome Pires, ultimately failed in his diplomatic mission and disappeared, though accounts vary as to his ultimate fate.

 

- Tomé Pires was a Portuguese trader who visited China in the early 1500s but learned the hard way that Europeans still counted for little in the Eastern world, which remained much more advanced and powerful at the time. 

- Population growth in both Eastern and Western cores roughly doubled between 1450-1600, creating hunger and poverty as resources could not keep up. 

- New World crops helped increase food supplies but did not solve the problem. Living standards declined across Europe and China as real wages fell back to pre-plague levels by 1500-1600. 

- Hunger and poverty increased, forcing many into vagrancy, crime, slavery or death. Societies hardened policies against the poor as conditions became more difficult even for the middle classes. It was a time of declining livelihoods across Eurasia.

 

- The passage discusses issues arising from population growth and economic changes in China and Japan in the 16th century. 

- In China, the civil service became overcrowded as the gentry class swelled, forcing poor scholars out of administrative positions. Corruption also increased as wealthy families used their influence to gain status and power. 

- In Japan, political authority had collapsed in the 15th century but gradually reconsolidated under large warlords in the 16th century aided by new firearms technology. One such warlord, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, reunified most of Japan by 1582. 

- Hideyoshi disarmed the population under the pretense of devotion but really to centralize control over taxation, conscription, and administration. He hoped to expand his empire by conquering China. 

- The Ming Empire of China was divided on expansion - some emperors pushed reforms while bureaucrats resisted changes. Taxation broke down amid these disputes, weakening the military. Coastal control was lost to smugglers and pirates. 

- Reform efforts by officials like Qi Jiguang and Zhang Zhuzheng achieved some successes but were ultimately abandoned after their deaths. Emperor Wanli withdrew from governance, stagnating the empire for decades. 

- Hideyoshi's invasion of Korea in 1592 initially succeeded but later stalled. After his death, the Japanese generals withdrew, ending thoughts of further expansion for now. Centralization and reform were no longer pursued as solutions in China or Japan after 1600.

 

- The Ottoman Empire was a powerful empire based in Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul) by the 1600s, with over 400,000 urban residents who needed food imports from throughout the Mediterranean region. 

- The sultans expanded the empire through conquest to secure these food supplies, maintaining a balance between nomadic cavalry and a professional infantry (Janissaries) recruited as slaves from conquered Christian populations. 

- The empire was well-managed with an expanding bureaucracy and system of assigning conquered lands as fiefs to keep different interest groups loyal. Alternating favors between the Janissaries and aristocracy also helped maintain control. 

- expansion brought conflicts, particularly with Shiite rebels in Anatolia and the Persian Empire. The Ottomans asserted Sunni dominance but ongoing wars were needed against these internal dissidents. 

- Major conquests included taking Egypt in 1517, gaining control of the Mediterranean grain trade with Constantinople. Further expansion into North Africa and Europe followed. 

- This brought the Ottomans into conflict with European powers like the Habsburgs, a wealthy dynasty controlling much of central and western Europe. Neither the Habsburgs nor Ottomans were able to achieve the complete domination over Europe that was feared or desired.

 

- The Spanish Empire's income could not keep up with its military expenses from fighting wars against the Ottoman Empire and other European states. Philip II took on massive debts but eventually declared bankruptcy multiple times as he could no longer pay his troops or creditors. 

- His unpaid armies resorted to looting, further damaging Spain's reputation and finances. By the time Philip II died in 1598, Spain's debt was 15 times its annual revenue and the empire was effectively bankrupt. 

- It would be over two centuries before another major Western European land empire emerged, by which point the Industrial Revolution was transforming the world. If the Habsburgs or Ottomans had united Europe in the 16th century, the Industrial Revolution may not have happened. 

- Neither Charles V/Philip II of Spain nor Suleiman the Magnificent of the Ottoman Empire were solely to blame for failing to unite Europe - the economic and military demands of doing so were simply beyond the capabilities and resources of any power at that time. Western Europe remained fragmented.

 

- In the 1600s, both China and central Europe experienced immense violence, social upheaval, and population loss due to factors like war, famine, disease, and economic collapse as their ruling dynasties failed. 

- In China, the decline of the Ming dynasty led to a period of warlordism in the 1630s. Armies ransacked the countryside, subjecting civilians to torture and brutality to extort money and goods from them. Beijing fell in 1644. 

- Central Europe experienced its deadliest phase of the Thirty Years' War from 1618-1648. Armies lived off extortion and looting, brutally torturing townspeople like those in Beelitz, Germany to extract money and information. Over 2 million died violently and famine/disease killed many more. 

- However, despite immense suffering, social development continued increasing rather than collapsing, unlike in previous eras. Both China and Europe approached 50 points on the social development index by 1800.

- A key reason was that by the late 1600s, the Russian and Chinese empires had effectively shut down the Eurasian steppe highway through agreements like the 1689 Nerchinsk accord. This enclosed nomadic populations and ended the periodic invasions and migrations that had previously disrupted states and spread destruction.

 

- In the 17th-18th centuries, the Qing dynasty in China and Romanov Russia effectively ended the threat from nomadic tribes by closing off the steppe highway into their empires. They consolidated control and established powerful armies that pushed the nomads further into Inner Asia. 

- At the same time, European powers like Portugal, Spain, France and England were opening up a new ocean highway for trade and empires by sailing around Africa and across the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Their early activities mirrored past empires like conquering territory for resources.

- Spain gained immense wealth from silver mining in South America, using privateers, pirates and smuggling to challenge Spanish control. Other European powers sought to claim territories and wealth for themselves through both legitimate trade/colonization and piracy/privateering. 

- By closing the steppe highway and internal conflicts, the nomadic tribes lost their influence and free movement, becoming restricted to frontier territories, while the agrarian empires like China and Russia expanded onto former nomadic lands. This represent a major change in relations between sedentary and nomadic powers in Eurasia.

 

- Early English colonies in North America, like those led by Francis Drake and Walter Raleigh, struggled or failed due to unrealistic plans and poor locations. Drake claimed land in modern-day California for Queen Elizabeth but didn't establish a permanent settlement. Raleigh's Roanoke colony on the North Carolina coast starved due to its isolation. 

- Native American populations declined dramatically due to diseases brought from Europe, falling by at least three-quarters within a few generations of Columbus's arrival. This gave colonists room to settle with little resistance and establish transplanted versions of European societies. 

- By the 1600s, colonists developed commodity-based economies in North America, exploiting ecological differences to produce goods like tobacco, timber, fish and rum for export back to European markets. This integrated the Atlantic world through triangular trade networks.

- Dutch and English merchants aggressively expanded into the Atlantic trade in the 1600s as Spain's grip weakened. This new Atlantic economy transformed labor by creating an interdependent, global marketplace, driving higher wages and prosperity particularly in the English and Dutch colonies of North America.

 

- In the 1600s and 1700s, Northwest Europe experienced economic and agricultural changes driven by the growing Atlantic economy and global trade. This expanded the range of goods available to common people and generated new jobs.

- More people took work in shops, factories, and other industrial pursuits to earn money to buy imported goods like tea, coffee, sugar, and newspapers. Farmers diversified from subsistence farming to produce for broader markets. 

- This marked the rise of the first consumer culture centered around the North Atlantic region. People worked harder and longer hours to earn money to buy these new goods. 

- During this time, philosophers like Francis Bacon and scientists like Galileo began to reject ancient authorities like Aristotle and embrace empirical observation and experimentation. They developed the idea that nature functions like a great machine or clockwork. 

- This mechanical philosophy yielded major scientific discoveries that contradicted ancient ideas, like Copernicus' theory that the earth revolves around the sun. Despite criticism, this new philosophy spread from Southern Europe to the Northwest. 

- Isaac Newton formalized this mechanical view of the universe with his theory of universal gravitation. This marked a major intellectual shift away from ancient authorities toward Enlightenment ideals of reason and science.

 Here is a summary of the provided text:

- In 1937, three Chinese scientists fled Nanjing for Cambridge, England to escape the war with Japan. This sparked Joseph Needham's interest in why modern science originated in Europe rather than China. 

- Needham fell in love with one of the Chinese scientists, Lu Gwei-djen, who helped him learn Chinese language and history. He developed a passionate interest in China. 

- Through working with Lu, Needham formulated what became known as "the Needham Problem" - why, after centuries of Chinese scientific preeminence, it was 17th century Europe that created modern science. 

- Needham dedicated decades to cataloging Chinese scientific accomplishments in an attempt to understand what happened. While he never fully solved the problem, his work provided greater context than was previously available in the 1930s.

- The real question is why, when social development again pressed against limits in the 17th century in both Europe and China, it was Europe that gave rise to modern science, not China. Needham spent his career researching this question.

 

- In the 17th and 18th centuries, Chinese intellectuals did not develop mechanical models of nature and seek to uncover its scientific secrets in the way that European intellectuals did during this period. 

- This was because the social and political conditions in China at the time did not put the same pressure on intellectuals to develop new scientific thinking. China had less need for precise measurements and standardized systems compared to Europeans exploring the new frontiers across the oceans.

- The Qing rulers in China actively sought to win over intellectuals and bring them back into state service, offering positions, exams, and patronage. This discouraged radical or unconventional thinking. 

- Jesuit missionaries introduced Western techniques like clocks, eyeglasses and astronomy to China. Their superior astronomical knowledge gained them prestige at the imperial court. Kangxi emperor embraced Western math and science.

- However, Kangxi still saw Western knowledge as derivative of older Chinese ideas. He eventually sidelined the Jesuits due to worries about their influence. Chinese science then fell further behind the West without this transmission of new ideas. 

- Even if Kangxi had fully promoted Western science, Chinese social development likely could not have kept pace with the West in the 18th century due to other geopolitical and economic factors favoring technological and industrial advancement in Europe.

 

- Gu Yanwu promoted a mechanistic view of nature akin to the Western scientific perspective, grounding arguments empirically rather than just in ancient texts. However, Dai Zhen always grounded his arguments in ancient texts, prioritizing preserving China's historical glories over addressing new questions from global expansion as in the West. 

- The challenges of the Atlantic frontier produced influential Western thinkers like Newton, Leibniz, Locke and Voltaire who advanced scientific and social theories. In China, scholars in Kangxi's institutes felt no need to make similar advances and focused more on making mathematics and medicine branches of classical studies.

- When social development reached certain thresholds in ancient Rome and Song China, disasters followed that reduced development. By Kangxi's death in 1722, development was higher than ever but stable due to closed steppe borders. Western development then surpassed Eastern, accessing a new Atlantic frontier. 

- By 1750, living standards were declining as development strained against hard ceilings. Various theories emerged to address this but isolationism grew in China and Japan while arms racing continued in the fragmented West due to their views on resolving resource constraints. Scientific advances organized violence more effectively in the West.

 

- Blackbeard, the notorious pirate, took extraordinary amounts of killing to defeat - he was hit by 5 musket balls and suffered 25 sword wounds before being killed. 

- By 1726, the number of pirate raids in the Caribbean dropped significantly from 50 raids in 1718 to just 6 raids, indicating the age of rampant piracy was coming to an end. 

- Financing wars required large sums of money that governments could not afford on their own. The Dutch pioneered national banks and public debt through selling long-term bonds. 

- England followed suit, establishing its own national bank and public debt system. This gave seemingly unlimited credit that allowed for constant wars. 

- The period from 1689-1815 saw almost continuous warfare between Britain and France for dominance in Europe, India, the Caribbean, and North America. These worldwide conflicts became known as the War of the West. 

- Britain's advantage was its strong credit and financial system, allowing it to outlast France and other rivals. However, huge debts were accumulated through constant warfare. 

- The American Revolution weakened Britain but it recovered through international trade. The French Revolution led to the rise of Napoleon, who threatened British control but could not overcome its financial power. 

- By 1815 Western European military and financial power, led by Britain, was far ahead of other regions through the effects of the prolonged global conflicts.

 

- The passage describes Matthew Boulton's Soho Manufactory, which housed powerful steam engines and advanced machinery. Boulton sold "power" in the form of steam energy. 

- James Watt's improvements to the steam engine, separating the condenser from the evaporation cylinder, dramatically increased efficiency and made steam power economically viable beyond just pumping water from coal mines. 

- Matthew Boulton partnered with Watt, providing funding and resources to develop the engine. Their improved engine could pump water using only a quarter as much coal as earlier models. 

- Early adopters of steam power included cotton cloth manufacturers. Mechanized spinning and weaving driven by steam engines displaced manual labor and allowed huge increases in productivity and output of cotton textiles. 

- The widespread adoption of steam power enabled by Watt and Boulton's innovations was a pivotal development that drove the Industrial Revolution and modern economic growth in Britain and beyond. It transformed societies and global power dynamics over the coming century.

 

The passage discusses the origins of the Industrial Revolution, specifically focusing on why it occurred first in Britain rather than elsewhere. It notes that technological innovations like Hargreaves's jenny, Arkwright's throstle, and Crompton's mule allowed cotton to be spun much faster, in hours rather than days. These machines were well-suited to steam power and large factories. The first steam-powered cotton spinning mill opened in 1785. 

British cotton production became cheaper, finer, and more uniform than even Indian cotton. Cotton exports from Britain increased 100-fold between 1760-1815, making it a major industry. Over 100,000 workers, including many children, worked long hours in mills. Prices fell drastically as production increased and more markets opened up. 

Geography helped Britain as its raw materials like cotton grew overseas, not competing for domestic land. American plantations producing cotton boomed, stimulated by demand from Britain. Eli Whitney's cotton gin further increased American cotton production and kept prices low. Technological changes also came to the iron industry in Britain.

The passage argues that while unique in scale and speed, the Industrial Revolution followed similar patterns to previous increases in development elsewhere. It occurred in Britain, a once peripheral area within the expanding Western core, as new advantages were discovered at the margins. A combination of accumulated technology, effective guns closing migration routes, and new maritime trade allowed Britain to overcome limitations that had stopped growth in places like Rome and China previously. Britain was particularly well-placed given its resources, finance, institutions, and position after wars with European rivals. However, industrialization was not inevitable for Britain alone.

 

The passage discusses the rise of industrialization in the West and contrasts it with the lack of industrialization in the East. It argues that by around 1750, Eastern and Western societies were quite similar agrarian economies, but industrialization took hold first in the West due to certain advantages and forces. 

The industrial revolution created a new class of wealthy industrialists and factory owners in the West. While some viewed them as heroic innovators, others like Dickens saw them as brutish "Gradgrinds" who dehumanized workers and valued facts and profit above all else. Industrialization dramatically increased productivity but workers did not share fully in these gains. Tensions rose as workers organized and radicals called for revolution. 

The passage disputes Marx's claim that landlords drove people off farms into cities, arguing instead that increased lifespans and population growth led to more children that families could not support on farms, driving migration to cities for work. Overall it examines how industrialization first emerged and took hold in the West, fundamentally transforming its societies compared to the Eastern world which did not independently industrialize at the same time.

 

- Britain's population roughly doubled between 1780-1830 to about 14 million, with 1 million staying in rural areas and 6 million moving to towns for work due to industrialization. 

- Wages in Britain actually rose after 1775 and pulled ahead of other Western countries, unlike previous population booms when wages collapsed. 

- In the 1830s, reforms began like limiting child labor in factories as living conditions improved and the idea of helping the poor became more accepted. 

- New technologies in the 1800s like steam engines, railroads, and ships dramatically reduced travel times around the world. Jules Verne's novel Around the World in 80 Days reflected this change.

- 5 million Britons emigrated between 1851-1880 mostly to North America, settling vast areas and fueling huge population booms in cities like New York and Chicago. 

- Industrialization spread across Europe in the late 1800s starting with Belgium and Germany, who learned from Britain's mistakes and applied science and management more systematically. 

- Major inventions like the gasoline engine and bicycle in 1885 further accelerated technological progress and globalization in the late 1800s-early 1900s.

 

- In the late 19th/early 20th century, cars and planes started transforming transportation. Early cars were slow but factories produced over a million vehicles by 1913. The Wright brothers pioneered powered flight in 1903.

- Oil became a key energy source, powering new engines and speeding up transportation like ships. Countries explored developing oil fields. Communications also accelerated with underwater cables, telegraphs, radios, and falling costs. 

- Faster transportation and communication expanded global markets dramatically. Economic thinkers like Adam Smith argued for free trade between nations to allow specialization and gains from trade. 

- Britain led the move to more open global trade in the late 1800s, lowering import tariffs. This accelerated growth as countries traded more. However, liberalization also shook up traditional social restrictions on movement, religion, gender roles and more over time. 

- Rapid changes transformed Western societies and pressures from their expanding economies and liberal markets pushed other regions to modernize and industrialize more quickly as well in a newly integrated global system. Overall this period saw the beginnings of modern globalization.

 

- Agricultural cores had independently developed in various regions, but rising social development linked these cores together through global trade and transport connections. 

- In the 16th century, Europeans used new ships to overwhelm the Aztec and Inca empires, turning Central/South America into peripheries of the expanding Western world. 

- In the 18th century, Europeans began exerting control over South Asia, establishing trade enclaves. 

- In the 19th century, steamships, railroads, and telegraphs gave Western nations global reach. Britain in particular could project power worldwide. Western industrialization greatly increased military capabilities.

- China resisted Western influence, restricting trade. Tensions escalated over the 1830s British opium trade, leading to the First Opium War in 1839 and China being forced to open ports. Western dominance expanded through military superiority. 

- By the 1860s, the West dominated global trade networks and imposed colonial rule over vast regions, transforming the global political/economic geography and incorporating new peripheries. Independent cores like China became peripheries to the Western core.

 

In the late 19th century, parts of Asia suffered under Western imperialism. In China and India, crop failures led to widespread famines that killed tens of millions as European powers continued exporting food. Disease and poor health compounded the death toll. Meanwhile, Europeans imposed unfair trade terms on Asian countries and interfered in their internal politics. 

Responses in Asia varied. Japan and China both launched modernization programs to adopt Western science and technology. Japan made faster initial progress, avoiding colonial rule and prioritizing education, infrastructure and industrialization. China made some reforms but was hindered by internal divisions and clashes with Western powers. 

Over time, Japan emerged as the clear leader in industrializing the East. It established a modern constitution, universal education, and railroads much earlier than China. While China stumbled, Japan raced ahead to become the first non-Western industrial power. Their different paths set the stage for future rivalry as both sought to resist and reform against Western imperial domination of Asia in the late 19th century.

 

- Japan industrialized and rearmed faster than China in the late 19th century, allowing it to hold off Western imperialists and dominate China. This marked the beginning of a "War of the East" as Japan sought to control China and Southeast Asia.

- However, this War of the East took place within the broader context of Western domination globally. When Japan defeated China in 1895, it alarmed Western powers like Germany and Russia. 

- In the early 20th century, Japan allied with Western powers by helping suppress the anti-Western Boxer Rebellion in China in 1900. This gained Japan recognition as a great power. But Japan also defeated Russia in 1905, showing the East's growing power relative to the West.

- Between 1914-1991, the world was engulfed in the massive wars known as the First World War, Second World War, and Cold War - a new "War of the West" that dwarfed previous conflicts. These subsumed and extended the earlier War of the East. 

- The wars led to the collapse of dynastic empires like China, Russia, Germany, Austria and the Ottomans that could no longer cope with modern total war. Power shifted to democratic states like the U.S. and U.K. 

- However, the costs of war bankrupted Western European nations. The financial center of gravity shifted across the Atlantic to the rising U.S., which emerged as the dominant global power after World War 1.

 

- After WWI, the US withdrew from its role as conductor of the international financial orchestra, leaving a vacuum. When the stock market crashed in 1929, the lack of coordination turned it into a worldwide financial crisis. 

- The Great Depression hit capitalism hard, with high unemployment. In contrast, the Soviet Union under Stalin rapidly industrialized despite harsh policies like forced collectivization and gulags. This contributed to the view that authoritarian models worked better.

- Japan and Germany embraced militarism and expansionism in response to economic troubles and the perceived weaknesses of Western democracies. Japan invaded Manchuria and China, while Hitler pursued rearmament and vowed to conquer land in the east for Germans. 

- WWII devastated Europe but left the US relatively unscathed. The war ended Western colonial empires but solidified the division of Europe between the American and Soviet spheres of influence. 

- The US launched the Marshall Plan to rebuild Western Europe and contain the spread of communism. Economic recovery was faster in the West than the Soviet-dominated East. The atomic arms race intensified tensions but also highlighted the dangers of nuclear war.

 

- The doctrine of Mutual Assured Destruction emerged during the Cold War, bringing the risk of nuclear annihilation but maintaining a tense peace between the US and Soviet Union. 

- Rather than direct conflict, they fought proxy wars in the developing world via supporting opposing sides like revolutionaries or dictators. 

- The US expected an easy win with its support of Nationalist China, but Mao's communists took over China in 1949, changing the strategic dynamics in East Asia. 

- This led to proxy conflicts like the Korean War and insurgencies across Southeast Asia as the Sino-Soviet bloc backed communist forces. While the US won some struggles, it was ultimately bogged down and defeated in Vietnam. 

- However, these so-called "wars of national liberation" were also fronts in the larger US-Soviet conflict. China and Japan avoided direct expansion after WWII despite past ambitions. 

- By the late 1960s, the strains of battling communists globally took their toll on the US. Meanwhile, its former allies and clients in Europe and East Asia were gaining economic strength while pushing for detente. 

- So in the end, the decisive arena was not military victory but commercial dominance, as Western economic and cultural influence undermined communist ideology through penetration of consumer markets.

 

- Before the 20th century, high mortality rates meant women needed to bear about 5 children on average to maintain population stability, spending most of their adult lives pregnant or nursing. 

- Improvements in health, sanitation, and medicine led to lower infant mortality in the late 19th/early 20th century, allowing populations to grow exponentially until fertility rates declined. 

- New forms of birth control like condoms in the 1920s and the oral contraceptive pill in the 1960s gave women more control over their fertility in rich countries. 

- Technological advances in appliances like washing machines, refrigerators, and vacuum cleaners reduced the drudgery of household tasks, freeing up women's time. More women entered the paid workforce as economies shifted toward services. 

- Books in the 1960s/70s urged women to seek fulfillment outside traditional roles. By the 1990s, men were starting to share more in household and childcare duties. 

- During the Cold War, the US used consumer goods like appliances and homes to show superiority over the Soviet model, with Nixon and Khrushchev debating washing machines. However, communist countries struggled to provide these modern conveniences to their populations. 

- The rise of computers and information technology in Western societies from the 1970s onward transformed industries and brought even greater wealth, while communist nations fell further behind in providing this new level of technology to their people.

 

- In the late 1950s, Mao launched the Great Leap Forward to rapidly industrialize China and catch up to Western nations. He collectivized agriculture, having peasants build backyard steel furnaces. Output fell as production targets were exaggerated. 

- Famine ensued from 1958-1962, with estimates of 20 million deaths. Stories described horrific scenes of starvation and families allowing the old and young to die first. 

- In the 1960s, Mao was sidelined as agriculture recovered under more pragmatic policies. But in 1966 he incited the Cultural Revolution, stoking class anger among youth. Red Guards attacked authorities and cultural relics. Chaos ensued as people turned on each other. 

- By 1969 Mao lost control of the movement. Millions had died or been persecuted, straining relations with the Soviets. In 1972, Nixon's visit signaled a pragmatic shift and acceptance of the West. After Mao's death in 1976, Deng Xiaoping pursued market reforms like decollectivization to spur economic growth through private enterprise and global integration.

 

- The war in Afghanistan dragged on through the 1980s, oil prices fell by two-thirds, and the US sharply increased military spending on high-tech weapons. 

- The Soviet leadership was worried about dissent growing as the economy could produce tanks but not consumer goods. A nuclear disaster at Chernobyl in 1986 further revealed the system was falling apart. 

- Gorbachev instituted reforms of perestroika and glasnost to restructure and increase transparency, but this had the unintended consequence of weakening communist control and strengthening demands for political freedom. 

- Inspired by reforms in the Soviet Union, protests grew in China but were violently suppressed at Tiananmen Square in 1989. In Eastern Europe, communist regimes began to fall as Gorbachev allowed free elections. 

- By 1991, independence movements in Soviet republics weakened the USSR to the point where Gorbachev had to formally dissolve the Soviet Union. The US emerged as the sole superpower after winning the Cold War.

- In China, Deng continued economic reforms and opening up, leading to massive growth that transformed China's role in the global economy over the following decades.

 

- China's exports increased 12-fold between 1992-2007 while its trade surplus with the US ballooned from $18 billion to $233 billion. Chinese goods filled 90% of shelves in American discount stores like Walmart by 2008. 
- China became the world's workshop, manufacturing goods cheaply. It was able to increase farmer's income by 50% while providing labor to manufacturers at a fraction of the cost in rich countries. 
- This allowed China to dominate global trade and industry. Two Chinese businessmen on a train discussed how foreigners valued scenery over industry and production. They wondered what Europe would do without much industry left and if an economy could run on just services.
- Half a century earlier, Mao had claimed the direction of the world winds had changed, with the east wind prevailing over the west. While not true then, by 2000 his words were coming true as China's rise signaled the beginning of the end of Western dominance after centuries of being the global leader in social and economic development.

 

- Physical geography, such as living on top of a coalfield, meant little to societies until the Industrial Revolution, when coal became a key resource fueling rapid social and economic growth. However, newer fuels like oil eventually displaced coal. 

- The story outlined farming origins in Southwest Asia and independent development in other regions like China. Western societies were generally first to experience problems of complexity as social development increased.

- Rising complexity led to issues like larger populations and need for better organization, driving invention of cities, states, and empires in places like Mesopotamia and China. Periodic collapses were often linked to climate changes exacerbating social instability.

- Interactions between states created new disruptions, and developing new ways of thinking (Axial Age reforms) helped break through development ceilings. But the Mediterranean and periodic invasions hampered long-term Western advances. 

- The rise of Rome and Han China connected Afro-Eurasia, fueling higher development but also catastrophic plagues. Both empires collapsed after 150CE, with different long-term impacts in the East/West cores. 

- Development surpassed the West by 1100 CE in China, but the hard ceiling could not be broken. The Second Old World Exchange again linked disruptions between East and West.

- Advantages of backwardness in Western Europe fueled its re-ascendance starting around 1400 CE, eventually discovering the Americas and enabling unprecedented social changes driving the modern world.

 

- The passage argues that while individual great leaders and decisions clearly impact history to some degree, the overall direction of history is determined more by large-scale geographic and economic factors, not individual wills. 

- Great men like Muhammad or inventors like Boulton/Watt accelerated processes already underway but likely did not fundamentally alter the course of history. Their achievements were also not entirely unique - others would have likely discovered similar things around the same time.

- Choices by large numbers of people, like postwar baby booms, can influence history more by acting as part of broad societal trends rather than individual eccentric decisions. 

- However, even mass movements are responding to circumstances rather than freely choosing history. Geography, resources and social/economic conditions exert strong pressures that influence collective choices.

- Ultimately, no individual or group can genuinely wrest history down an entirely new path. The rise and fall of civilizations is steered more by impersonal geographic and material realities than personal wills, though the latter can accelerate or slightly modify the former.

 

- By around 200 CE, as the great Han and Roman empires fell apart, theological questions arose over the relationship between organized churches and individual believers in an increasingly chaotic world, marking the beginning of second-wave axial thought. 

- When social development revived around 1000 CE in China and 1400 CE in Italy, questions focused on how to regain wisdom from antiquity and move past recent periods of decline, characterized as renaissance thought.

- Eastern and Western intellectual developments followed similar paths due to social and political changes that drove thinking in similar directions. Centralized states led to first-wave axial thought, their decline pushed second-wave axial thought, and revivals sparked renaissances. 

- The scientific revolution in Europe around 1600 represented a divergence, but psychological experiments show cultural differences in thinking styles are a matter of familiarity rather than inherent ability. Context-dependent vs. fact-based thinking can be cultivated or dampened based on social needs.

- Many intellectual paths appeared in different cultures depending on changing historical challenges rather than fixed cultural traits. Cultures accommodate new thinking as required by social development. Stagnation represents turning inward rather than immutable deficiencies.

 

- The likelihood of Western rule by 2000 gradually increased over time but was never a certainty. It was more of a long-term probability than a lock-in or accident.

- In 1100, Eastern rule by 2000 was plausible if China had avoided major invasions and continued its economic and cultural renaissance. The odds were long but it was possible. 

- By 1500, Western rule was more likely (around 50-50) due to Europe developing ships, guns, and nascent Atlantic trade. Different events could still have changed the outcome.

- In 1650, Western rule was even more probable (around 80%) as the industrial preconditions were taking shape in Europe. But other regions like China could have caught up more quickly with the right circumstances. 

- By 1800, Western rule was highly likely to occur given no major delays to industrialization. However, it was not completely locked in.

- Going further back, there was no way for Rome or other early civilizations to industrialize first given technological and economic limitations. Eastern rule always remained unlikely, while gradual Western development became increasingly probable over time.

- The only event that could have prevented overall industrialization was a global catastrophe like an asteroid impact, not smaller changes to institutions, policies or invasions. Western rule by 2000 was the most plausible scenario but not guaranteed or inevitable.

 

- The passage discusses Isaac Asimov's short story "Nightfall" and Foundation novels as examples of how history and predicting the future has been modeled in sci-fi. 

- "Nightfall" depicts a civilization destroyed by a rare astronomical event, suggesting history is beyond human control. The Foundation novels take a different approach.

- In the Foundation novels, mathematician Hari Seldon develops "psychohistory," which uses statistics, history, and psychology to predict large-scale social and historical trends. 

- Seldon uses psychohistory to forecast the fall of the Galactic Empire and a dark age, but also reveals his plan through the "Foundation" think tank to restore the empire in just 1,000 years rather than the predicted 30,000 years.

- While the Foundation novels are entertaining sci-fi, most professional historians are skeptical that looking at past patterns could reliably predict the future. They dispute there are clear, identifiable patterns driving humanity's course.

So in summary, it contrasts "Nightfall's" depiction of history as outside human control, with the Foundation novels' notion of predicting the future through "psychohistory," but notes historians are generally doubtful of the latter approach.

 

- The author argues that most predictions about the future tend to only look back a few hundred years of history, which is too short of a perspective. They take the approach of just the "Ghost of Christmas Present" rather than learning from the longer-term "Ghost of Christmas Past".

- Looking further back, at least 500 generations or more, allows patterns to emerge that can help foresee the future. This is the approach taken by Scrooge and Hari Seldon in learning lessons from history. 

- If current trends continue with Eastern and Western social development rising at the same rate as the 20th century, the East will overtake the West by around 2103. But accelerating development may mean the East regains global leadership even sooner.

- After 2000, an unusual relationship called "Chimerica" emerged between the Western core and Eastern periphery, with China lending the US money to buy Chinese goods through investing trade surpluses. This boosted both economies but was unstable. 

- The 2008 financial crisis exposed weaknesses in this model as bubbles burst. The East was still growing quicker than the heavily indebted West in its recovery. This suggests the Western era may be drawing to a close sooner than linear projections indicate, if historical patterns of development play out.

 This summary captures the key points:

- In 1989 capitalism saved China after Tiananmen Square. In 2009, China in turn arguably saved global capitalism after the financial crisis, becoming more significant on the world stage. 

- There is debate around whether the early 21st century will see power and wealth draining across the Pacific from the US to China, analogous to the shift from Europe to the US in the early 20th century. 

- However, others argue the US has rebounded from crises before and will adapt again. China also faces its own challenges around wages, demographics, resources and economic/political stability. 

- Some envision a globalized world where rising prosperity benefits all countries regardless of which dominates economically and politically. Others foresee China imposing its own hierarchical, non-Western system on a Sino-centric global order by the late 21st century. 

- The futures discussed range from continued Western dominance to global convergence to a clash of civilizations, depending on how economic and geopolitical trends evolve and the choices of future leaders. Ultimately the outcome is uncertain and debated among different viewpoints.

 

- The passage discusses a graph (Figure 12.1) that plots social development over time, showing it will rise another 4,000 points in the next century. This represents an unprecedented transformation compared to previous eras. 

- By 2103, with a social development score of 5,000 points, predictions include cities of 140 million people consuming huge amounts of energy daily, vastly increased warfare technology like robot soldiers and nanoweapons, and near-total information access through brain-computer interfaces. 

- The passage argues these changes imply our conceptions of biology, sociology, and what it means to be human will be profoundly disrupted. This could represent a "Singularity" as predicted by futurists like Kurzweil, where technology expands exponentially and merges with human intelligence.

- Early signs of this include medical advances extending lifespans and improving quality of life, as well as genetic research and bionic implants already beginning to enhance human abilities and attributes. The passage discusses both promise and ethical concerns around possibilities like designer babies and partial human immortality.

- In summary, the passage argues the coming century represents an unprecedented discontinuity in history that will transform humanity by merging us with technology at a scale and speed beyond all previous experience.

 

- The passage discusses emerging biotechnologies like genetic engineering, human enhancement, and brain-computer interfaces. These have potential benefits but also raise ethical concerns about playing God or exacerbating social inequalities. 

- Military research at DARPA is aiming to enhance soldiers with brain implants for communication, memory, etc. The National Science Foundation predicts "network-enabled telepathy" may be possible by the 2020s. 

- IBM is making progress simulating rodent and human brains on supercomputers. If trends continue, a computer capable of modeling the human brain may exist by the 2020s-2040s, fulfilling Ray Kurzweil's vision of a technological singularity. 

- Advances in DNA synthesis, synthetic biology, and other fields could enable entirely new kinds of organisms and transformations to what it means to be human by the 2020s-2040s. This may greatly disrupt societies as previous revolutions have.

- However, these emerging technologies are currently dominated by Western nations like the US. Eastern countries are increasing investment but it's unclear if current trends will continue. 

- There are also concerns these accelerating changes could encounter a "hard ceiling" and trigger widespread collapse, as occurred previously when societies exceeded environmental or social limits. Issues like climate change, pandemics, and resource scarcity pose major risks.

 

- Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere have risen significantly since the industrial revolution and are projected to exceed 550 parts per million by 2050, higher than any time in the last 24 million years. 

- Even if emissions stopped today, the carbon already in the atmosphere means continued warming through positive feedback loops as the climate system responds. The North Pole ice will melt and sea levels will rise substantially.

- warming will cause more extreme weather like hurricanes, fires, and droughts. Agriculture will be impacted with lower crop yields in many regions. 

- Hundreds of millions of "climate migrants" may flee areas impacted by drought, famine and rising seas, straining resources in destination regions. Conflicts over resources could increase.

- Migration and deteriorating conditions raise the risk of pandemics spreading disease more rapidly worldwide. A severe pandemic could kill millions and cause a major global economic crisis. 

- The interconnected impacts of climate change, famine, migration and disease risk further destabilizing nations, particularly in the "arc of instability" stretching from Africa through Asia where many of the world's poorest live. This could unleash conflict and state failure.

- The impacts are highly uncertain and complex, with potential tipping points and feedbacks that could significantly accelerate or worsen the effects of warming in non-linear ways that are difficult to model and predict.

 

- The "arc of instability" region, which includes many Middle Eastern and Central Asian countries, is home to unstable regimes that may collapse like Afghanistan or Somalia, worsening suffering and creating havens for terrorists. 

- If instability spreads to core economic powers that are tied to the region's resources through trade and energy, it could trigger a "mother of all worst-case scenarios."

- Since the 1940s, major powers like the U.S., Europe, Soviet Union/Russia, and now China have viewed the region strategically due to its oil reserves, intervening regularly to secure access and influence. 

- Chinese demand for resources, coupled with anxieties about its rising power, is exacerbating tensions with Western interests in the unstable region. 

- Proliferation of nuclear weapons to countries like Iran and the risk of such weapons falling into terrorist hands raises the threat level substantially if conflicts erupt. 

- Major power confrontations in this volatile region could easily escalate and spiral out of control, risking catastrophic outcomes like nuclear war given their military entanglements and arsenals. All-out war would have disastrous costs but must still be avoided.

- The 21st century is shaping up as a "race" between a potential revolutionary Singularity and a collapse scenario dubbed "Nightfall," with humanity's future success or failure hanging in the balance. Strategic cooperation to prevent nuclear war is paramount but proliferation challenges remain acute.

 

The passage discusses two major issues facing humanity - nuclear war and global climate change. On nuclear war, the risk has decreased substantially in recent decades as nuclear weapons stockpiles have been reduced. However, global climate change poses a greater challenge as efforts to curb emissions through agreements like the Kyoto Protocol have fallen short of targets. 

The passage argues that states alone cannot effectively address problems like nuclear war and climate change due to their global scale. It cites Einstein's view that the only solution is creating a world government. While a full world government may not be realistic, increasing cooperation through international organizations could help limit these threats.

Specific points made include:

- Cooperation between nuclear powers since the 1980s has significantly reduced risks of nuclear war.

- Efforts to curb emissions through the Kyoto Protocol failed to meet targets, and the Copenhagen summit in 2009 produced no binding agreement. 

- Problems are now on a global scale that individual states cannot address alone. International cooperation through bodies like the UN is needed.

- Einstein argued world government was the only way to prevent nuclear destruction following WWII. Increased cooperation between states and non-state actors may help address these issues without full world government.

 

The passage discusses two possible outcomes for humanity's future - the "Singularity" where advanced technology ushers in an era of clean, abundant energy, or "Nightfall" where civilizations destroy themselves. 

It notes that fears over nuclear energy have hampered development since the 1970s, but new thinking could change that. Alternatively, solar power harvesting could meet all human needs if harnessed efficiently, or nanotechnology and genetics may unlock new sources. Significant technological advances are needed to achieve clean energy abundance. 

Referring to physicist Enrico Fermi's observation that we haven't encountered aliens despite the vast size of the universe, some scientists think this "Fermi paradox" means advanced civilizations inevitably self-destruct, predicting humanity's demise by 2045. However, calculations of potential alien civilizations vary widely. 

The passage argues history suggests a continued economic shift from West to East this century. Technological change may increase instability as more nations gain advanced weapons. Great statesmanship will be needed to avoid war as American power declines post-2040. Clean, renewable energy and robotics/nanotech could help reduce resource conflicts and global pressures if developed successfully. But ultimately, neither the Singularity or Nightfall outcomes can be certain - humanity's future remains an open question.

 

- The author argues that environmental changes throughout history, like drying forests and ice ages, created conditions where new variants with advantageous traits like larger brains could flourish and replace earlier humans. This evolutionary process may be happening again in the 21st century.

- Mass extinctions are currently underway due to humans, with one species disappearing every 20 minutes. Some experts predict up to two-thirds of species could be extinct by 2100. However, this could create opportunities for organisms with "new kinds of brains" that merge humans and machines. 

- The emerging Singularity, predicted for the 2040s, could initially involve merging of human and artificial intelligence. But some experts suspect AI may then surpass human intelligence and replace humans altogether. This would end biology and humanity's role in history.

- A post-Singularity world led by superintelligent AI would make geographical distinctions like East and West irrelevant. Long-term theories of historical change and the significance of regions would lose meaning in this transformed landscape. The important history would be the global, evolutionary progression from simple to highly advanced life.

 

- The author proposes using history as a way to study and understand social development over time, in order to help prevent humanity's failures and mistakes from destroying us in the future. 

- They introduce a "social development index" to quantify and compare how developed different societies were at different points in history based on four traits: energy capture, organization/urbanization, war-making ability, and information technology. 

- The index shows the West leading the East for most of the past 16,000 years, until the East overtook it between 550-1750 CE, and the West regaining the lead after the industrial revolution. 

- The author acknowledges some potential objections or criticisms to their approach, including dehumanizing societies, measuring the wrong traits, omitting important traits, or making factual errors. However, they argue their approach is still useful for answering comparative, quantitative questions like why the West came to rule.

- They provide some data and calculations to back up the social development index scores they assign to different societies over time, particularly around energy capture as the most important trait historically.

So in summary, the author proposes using a social development index and history to help prevent future failures, and outlines their approach while acknowledging some limitations or criticisms.

 Here is a summary of the key points about energy capture and social development scores over preindustrial history according to the passage:

- Energy capture (a measure of productivity and consumption) was highest in the 1st century CE Roman world at around 31,000 kcal/person/day, declining until 500 CE and faster until 700 CE. 

- Energy capture was likely lower in 1000 BCE than both Roman times and the 8th century CE, estimated at 20,000 kcal/person/day in 1000 BCE. 

- Organizational capacity, as measured by largest city size, generally increased over time but saw a dip in the mid-1st millennium CE in both East and West. 

- War-making capacity saw massive increases over time, especially in the 19th-20th centuries with industrialization. The West had far greater military power than the East from the 19th century onwards. 

- Estimates are provided for energy capture, organization, and war-making scores at various points in preindustrial history to quantify relative social development levels, though these involve significant subjectivity. The overall trends suggest social development increased steadily over the long term.

 

- In 1500 CE, European armies were probably twice as effective as those five centuries earlier, due more to size/logistics than firepower. 

- It's difficult to compare 1500 CE Western armies to Roman legions. Estimates suggest Roman legions had similar effectiveness to 1500 CE Europeans, but not to later "military revolution" forces. 

- Han Chinese forces in 200 BCE-200 CE seemed less effective than Roman legions, though Chinese military power declined less after global exchanges. By 700 CE, the gap between Chinese and Western forces was enormous. 

- Pre-1900 BCE armies in East/West were much weaker than later Roman/Han empires. Egyptian/Mesopotamian armies around 3000 BCE were probably more effective.

- Information technology is quantified based on literacy rates (full, medium, basic) among men/women over time. Points are assigned based on literacy levels. 

- Electronic info tech gets a multiplier of 2.5 (West) and 1.89 (East) in 2000. Electrical gets 0.05 (West 1900). Pre-electrical gets 0.01 in all periods. 

- Estimates have significant margins of error. Changing scores 10% in one direction severely strains credibility and changes the overall shape of social development trends.

 

- The passage discusses figures A.2a and A.2b from the text, which attempt to show how historical patterns would change if Western development scores were systematically increased and Eastern scores decreased (Figure A.2a), or vice versa (Figure A.2b). 

- However, the implications of these figures seem implausible or incorrect. For example, Figure A.2a depicts Western development as lower than Eastern development in Confucius's time, which is unlikely. 

- Figures A.3a and A.3b then show what would happen if the errors in development scores were an even greater 20% rather than 10%. 

- Figure A.3a, with Western scores increased 20% and Eastern decreased 20%, depicts Western development always higher, invalidating the author's theories. Figure A.3b reverses this.

- The author argues none of these scenarios seem credible given what is known about histories of different regions. Therefore, the basic patterns of development put forward in the book still hold even allowing for some margin of error in the development index scores. Precision of more than 10-20% is not needed to explain the overall trends.
