- The goal is to drive traffic from rankings to the affiliate links in the video descriptions to generate sales and commissions. 

- Following this blueprint is presented as a way to start a successful part-time or full-time affiliate business through video marketing on Amazon.

 

- The method involves finding popular gift-related keywords that people search for on Google using keyword research tools. These keywords will be used to drive traffic to the website. 

- The next step is to create a website where you can write reviews of products related to those keyword topics (e.g. gifts for her, birthday gifts, anniversary gifts, etc.). 

- Detailed product reviews are written for gifts ranked highly in search results for the target keywords. Affiliate links are included to earn a commission if someone buys through the link.

- Basic SEO techniques like backlinks are used to help rank the website and product reviews quickly in search results for the targeted keywords. This directs organic traffic from Google to the site and reviews.

- The goal is to leverage free traffic from Google to drive sales of affiliate products and earn commissions, without having to do much marketing yourself once the initial setup work is complete. Repeat the process for many gift-related keywords to scale up earnings.

So in summary, it involves finding high-traffic gift keywords, writing reviews for related products including affiliate links, and using SEO to rank those pages to earn affiliate commissions from the free traffic. The keywords are provided to simplify getting started.

Let me know if any part of the process needs more clarification or if you have additional questions! Getting your basic WordPress site set up is pretty straightforward with these high-level steps.

 

- You registered a domain name and hosting through a registrar like Bluehost. 

- Through the registrar's portal, you changed the nameservers to point to your hosting account. This may take 24-48 hours to propagate. 

- You accessed the cPanel control panel for your hosting account to install WordPress through Fantastico or one-click install. 

- You configured WordPress by setting the site title, description, etc. and activated themes and plugins like SEO, caching, sitemaps.

- It provides tips for creating compelling content like using personal experiences and recommending credible products/services. 

- It suggests using an SEO checklist to optimize elements like headlines, meta tags, images, internal linking, analytics, and social links.

- Writing product reviews should be honest, mention pros and cons, include affiliate links, and follow best practices from other reviews.

- Keys for a successful affiliate site include relevant and compelling content, proper use of SEO tags, and outbound links to credible external sources.

 

- The passage discusses setting up an Amazon affiliate website to earn commissions by promoting and reviewing products. 

- The first step is choosing keywords related to products on Amazon. The keywords should indicate buyer intent, not just have high search volume. Long tail keywords and buyer keywords are optimal as they are easiest to rank for but still indicate purchase intent. 

- The second step is finding products on Amazon related to the chosen keywords to promote. 

- The third step is creating a website to discuss and review the products. 

- The fourth step is signing up as an Amazon affiliate to earn commissions. 

- The fifth step is using SEO and YouTube videos to rank the website and drive traffic to it from Google and YouTube searches for the keywords. 

- The sixth step is publishing reviews and recommendations of products on the site to earn affiliate commissions when visitors purchase through the links. 

- The passage recommends starting with a budget of $100-200 for domains, hosting and SEO tools to set up initial sites. 

- It suggests repeating the process to scale up and build multiple affiliate sites targeting different keywords and products as a potential full-time business model.

The key points focus on setting up an Amazon affiliate website business by choosing profitable keywords, finding products to promote for those keywords, creating a review/discussion site, optimizing it for traffic, and earning commissions by publishing reviews and recommendations that drive sales.

 

- The author recommends focusing on long tail buyer keywords related to solving problems or fulfilling needs, rather than broad informational keywords. 

- Buyer keywords are those people are searching for with the intent to buy a product or solve an issue. Examples of identifying buyer keywords are keywords with "how to cure", "where to buy", etc. 

- The Google Keyword Planner tool can be used to find low competition buyer keywords under popular keyphrases like "how to cure back pain". 

- Once keywords are identified, search for related products on Amazon to promote as an affiliate. Products priced $20 or higher are recommended. 

- A website is then created on WordPress to review and promote the products. This involves registering a domain name, hosting, installing WordPress, choosing a theme, and setting up important plugins.

- The final step is signing up for an Amazon Associates affiliate account so earnings can be made from affiliate links to recommended products.

In summary, the process outlined is about researching buyer keywords, finding affiliate products to promote for those keywords, building a basic WordPress site, and signing up as an Amazon affiliate to monetize the site.

 

- Complete your Amazon Associates account profile with details about your website and choose product categories. 

- Get affiliate product links by searching for ASIN codes on Amazon's site. 

- Create website content reviewing/discussing products related to your target keywords. 

- Sign up for Amazon Associates to generate affiliate links for products.

- Rank your website on Google using private blog networks (PBNs) with expired domain names. Purchase 5+ expired domains for $50-60 total. 

- Set up PBNs following the same process as the money site but host them separately. 

- Create YouTube videos reviewing products. Optimize videos for keywords in title, description, tags etc. 

- Hire Fiverr sellers to send backlinks to website/YouTube video to boost rankings. 

- The process involves researching keywords, creating website/video content, joining Amazon Associates, building PBNs/links, and promoting on YouTube to drive traffic to the website with affiliate links. The goal is to rank for keywords and generate sales commissions.

 

- The guide provides tips for creating an affiliate website and marketing products to generate sales commissions. 

- It emphasizes writing honest, unbiased product reviews that outline both pros and cons while linking to affiliate links. Reviews should be based on reading other customer reviews.

- Other tips include optimizing content with SEO tags like H1 and H2 headings, including relevant outbound links, and focusing on compelling, solution-oriented content. 

- Once a successful product is identified, the guide discusses the potential to private label the product by having it manufactured in China and selling it through Amazon FBA (Fulfillment by Amazon). 

- Criteria for evaluating good private label product opportunities include ensuring it's an allowed Amazon category, having a profitable price markup over manufacturing costs, a minimum selling price of $10-20, ease of shipping, ability to brand, strong sales rankings on Amazon, uniqueness versus "me too" products, being evergreen rather than seasonal, and optional criteria like being consumable or a product the seller actually uses.

- Example affiliate websites are provided as models to learn content styles and types of products promoted at different price ranges. The goal is to build a successful affiliate site that can potentially be expanded into private labeling and branding opportunites.

 

- The number of reviews for a product doesn't necessarily indicate the quality of the product or opportunity for a new seller. It just means there are a lot of buyers in that market. 

- Competition is good as it means there is demand. However, look closely at the reviews, especially negative ones, to understand what customers want and don't want. This provides insights on how you can potentially improve upon existing products. 

- If existing products being sold seem to have room for improvement, that presents a good opportunity for a new seller to enter the market with a better product, better positioning, etc. to meet customer needs and wants that existing options are lacking. Looking closely at reviews is helpful for identifying improvement opportunities.
